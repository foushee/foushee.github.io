<li><span class="sc"><strong>Slow to warm or cautious:</strong></span> Children with this temperament may be hesitant or fearful in unfamiliar situations, move slowly, and prefer to watch a situation for a while before joining in.

<div class="content">
	<!--<h2><strong>WHAT</strong></h2>
<p><em>Remember that your child is now elementary-school-aged.</em></p>-->
<p></p>
<p>In your assignment for this week, you will be thinking about your child's experience with language, literacy, and the digital world outside of school, and how that connects to their experience of language and literacy inside of school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do your best to ground your writing in research about the place your child is from. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ethnologue.com/browse/countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethnologue</a> provides information about the languages spoken around the world and basic information about how they're used</li>
<li>many Censuses collect information about people's "mother tongues"</li>
<li>you can find relevant information on things like internet access and literacy rates <a href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/?f=&amp;resource-topic%5B%5D=education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></li>
<li>I like to get a sense of the "linguistic landscape" of a place by using <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">street view on Google Maps</a> (e.g, is there a lot of signage? what language(s) is it in?).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your write-up should address the following:</p>
<h3>1. Your child's language environment <em>(~150-200 words)</em></h3>
<p>Describe your child's language environment outside of school, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the languages and dialects that they hear spoken around them and by whom (e.g., what do their family members speak? their neighbors? teachers? friends?)</li>
<li>the language(s) that they themselves speak or understand</li>
<li>what their relationship to those languages is, and/or how they learned them&nbsp;</li>
<li>who they most often have conversations with (groups of other children? a parent? grandparent?)</li>
<li>where they are exposed to written language (e.g., books in the home and at school, signs, labels or packaging...), and in what language</li>
<li>+ <em>Remember to think about digital environments, as well!</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>2. ...and language skill, knowledge, and identity <em>(~100-150 words)</em></h3>
<p>Describe your child's language knowledge/skill, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are they really skilled at, when it comes to using language? (e.g., telling stories or jokes, understanding speakers&rsquo; hidden meanings, memorizing the words to songs, translating from one language to another, being polite...)</li>
<li>What do they have a lot of language for (e.g., do they know the names of all the dinosaurs? plant or animal names? saints? how to describe interpersonal relationships?)</li>
<li>How does their language relate to their identity?</li>
<li>What is their experience with reading?</li>
<li>What is their <em>relationship</em> to reading?</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. School language environment <em>(~200-250 words)</em></h3>
<p>Now, given the context that you have developed in the previous two sections, think about how your child's language experience, knowledge, and skill relate to language use and knowledge in your child's school environment. Questions to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does how language is used in your child's school environment compare to how language is used in your child's life outside of school?</li>
<li>What are the language and literacy skills that are important in your child&rsquo;s school environment, and how do those relate to the skills that your child has developed (<em>How does what your child's teachers think is important for your child to demonstrate, and what your child's caregivers think is important for the child to demonstrate, relate</em>?)</li>
<li>What is the language knowledge that is important in your child&rsquo;s school environment, and how does it relate to your child's language knowledge? (<em>How representative is your child's language knowledge of what is assumed by teachers, used by teachers to evaluate children, or tested on exams?</em>)</li>
<li>How does the way that the written word and digital technology appear in your child's school environment and how they appear in your child's environment outside of school, relate?</li>
</ul>
