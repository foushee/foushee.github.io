	abstract = \{Having recognized the need for diversity spotlighted by K\\&G (2022)---but given that sampling all the world's languages is infeasible---we focus on which dimensions of variability researchers should prioritize. \
We consider three major approaches to the study of child language learning, namely, language as a: \
\\begin\{inparaenum\}[(1)]\
    \\item cognitive puzzle, \
    \\item clinical/educational object, and \
    \\item window onto socialization.\
\\end\{inparaenum\} \
We discuss how what is important about `diversity' from each of these perspectives dictates the sociolinguistic communities from which researchers should sample.\},\
