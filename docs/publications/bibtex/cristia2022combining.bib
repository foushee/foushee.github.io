	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that children play an active role in their own learning in many domains, yet the study of language development has typically cast children as passive recipients of adult guidance. We argue that this approach overlooks language learning as a fruitful domain in which to explore children's active, self-directed learning --- specifically, instances where children seize language learning opportunities and/or select the linguistic information they want to receive, thereby enhancing their own learning. We suggest that reframing the child as an active language learner introduces novel explanations for key phenomena in language development, and offers researchers complex, ecologically valid tests of rational learning accounts.},
