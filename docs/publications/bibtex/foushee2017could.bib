	Abstract = {While some word meanings, like ``spotted,'' depend on intersubjectively accessible properties of the world, others like ``pretty'' invoke speakers' subjective beliefs. We explored children and adults' sensitivity to the subjectivity of a range of adjectives, including words like ``spotted'' and ``pretty,'' but also words like ``tall,'' which are evaluated relative to a standard. Participants saw two speakers who had independently experienced sets of exemplars of a novel object kind disagree about whether a critical exemplar was, e.g., ``tall,'' ``pretty,'' and ``spotted.'' In Experiments 1 and 3, speakers had seen distinct sets of exemplars, while in Experiments 2 and 4, the sets were identical. Adults always judged disagreements over words like ``pretty'' as faultless---indicating that both speakers ``could be right''---and permitted less faultless disagreement for ones like ``tall'' when the speakers had experienced identical sets of exemplars. Strikingly, children did not respond in an adult-like manner until age 8 or 9, but their explanations for speakers' conflicting assertions suggested some sensitivity to the kinds
of knowledge relevant for evaluating different adjectives.},
