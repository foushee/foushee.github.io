	abstract = {Overhearing can be seen as an instance of active learning, and overheard speech provides an increasingly viable source of linguistic input across development. However, previous studies of overhearing have often tested learning from simplified, pedagogic, adult-directed speech. This study extends previous results to a more ecologically valid context. Children learn multiple words and facts corresponding to novel toys either through a naturalistic overheard phone call or through direct instruction. Remarkably, 4.5--6-year-olds learned four new words above chance and equally well in both conditions. Their performance on a set of six facts was even better, especially when they were taught them directly. Analysis of the videos revealed that older children with high test accuracy both looked toward the experimenter often, and reliably played with individual objects as she discussed them in her phone call. 3-- 4.5-year-olds, on the other hand, showed a greater difference between overhearing versus direct instruction, with learning from overhearing suffering for both words and facts. While their overheard word-learning was at chance, they were able to learn facts, and succeed at both when taught directly. Together, these results suggest learning from overhearing is driven by attention to the indirect input, and may be a skill that undergoes substantial development during the preschool years.},
