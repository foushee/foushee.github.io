	Abstract = {This study focuses on parent--child book reading and its connection to the development of a theory of mind. First, parents were asked to report about frequency of parent--child storybook reading at home. Second, mothers were asked to read four picture-books to thirty-four children between 4;0 and 5;0. Both frequency of parent--child storybook reading at home, and mother's use of mental state terms in picture-books reading tasks were significantly associated with success on false belief tasks, after partialling out a number of potential mediators such as age of children, verbal IQ, paternal education, and words used by mothers in joint picture-book reading. Among the different mental state references (cognitive terms, desires, emotions and perceptions), it was found that the frequency and variety of cognitive terms, but also the frequency of emotional terms correlated positively with children's false belief performance. Relationships between mental state language and theory of mind are discussed.},

@article{akhtar_robustness_2005,
	Abstract = {Two studies examined the robustness of vocabulary learning through overhearing by testing 48 2-year-olds in contexts in which a potentially distracting activity was present (Studies 1 and 2) and in which the novel word was embedded in a directive rather than a labeling statement (Study 2). The children were equally good at learning a novel object label when there was no distracting activity as when there was. They were also able to learn the word when the object was not explicitly labeled. These findings suggest that young children are keen observers of third-party interactions and that their linguistic input consists of more than just speech directly addressed to them.},

Measures of effortful control, false belief understanding, and the inhibitory control and attention-shifting aspects of executive function in preschool were related to measures of math and literacy ability in kindergarten. Results indicated that the various aspects of child self-regulation accounted for unique variance in the academic outcomes independent of general intelligence and that the inhibitory control aspect of executive function was a prominent correlate of both early math and reading ability. Findings suggest that curricula designed to improve self-regulation skills as well as enhance early academic abilities may be most effective in helping children succeed in school.},

@article{bierman_executive_2008,
	Abstract = {Despite their potentially central role in fostering school readiness, executive function (EF) skills have received little explicit attention in the design and evaluation of school readiness interventions for socioeconomically disadvantaged children. The present study examined a set of five EF measures in the context of a randomized-controlled trial of a research-based intervention integrated into Head Start programs (Head Start REDI). Three hundred fifty-six 4-year-old children (17\% Hispanic, 25\% African American; 54\% girls) were followed over the course of the prekindergarten year. Initial EF predicted gains in cognitive and social--emotional skills and moderated the impact of the Head Start REDI intervention on some outcomes. The REDI intervention promoted gains on two EF measures, which partially mediated intervention effects on school readiness. We discuss the importance of further study of the neurobiological bases of school readiness, the implications for intervention design, and the value of incorporating markers of neurobiological processes into school readiness interventions.

@article{barnett_educational_2008,
	Abstract = {The effectiveness of the Tools of the Mind (Tools) curriculum in improving the education of 3- and 4-year-old children was evaluated by means of a randomized trial. The Tools curriculum, based on the work of Vygotsky, focuses on the development of self-regulation at the same time as teaching literacy and mathematics skills in a way that is socially mediated by peers and teachers and with a focus on play. The control group experienced an established district-created model described as a "balanced literacy curriculum with themes." Teachers and students were randomly assigned to either treatment or control classrooms. Children (88 Tools and 122 control) were compared on social behavior, language, and literacy growth. The Tools curriculum was found to improve classroom quality and children's executive function as indicated by lower scores on a problem behavior scale. There were indications that Tools also improved children's language development, but these effects were smaller and did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance in multi-level models or after adjustments for multiple comparisons. Our findings indicate that a developmentally appropriate curriculum with a strong emphasis on play can enhance learning and development so as to improve both the social and academic success of young children. Moreover, it is suggested that to the extent child care commonly increases behavior problems this outcome may be reversed through the use of more appropriate curricula that actually enhance self-regulation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{american_academy_of_pediatrics_literacy_2014,
	Abstract = {Reading regularly with young children stimulates optimal patterns of brain development and strengthens parent-child relationships at a critical
time in child development, which, in turn, builds language, literacy, and social-emotional skills that last a lifetime. Pediatric providers have a unique opportunity to encourage parents to engage in this important and enjoyable activity with their children beginning in infancy. Research has revealed that parents listen and children learn as a result of literacy
promotion by pediatricians, which provides a practical and evidence-based opportunity to support early brain development in primary care practice. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that
pediatric providers promote early literacy development for children beginning in infancy and continuing at least until the age of kindergarten entry by (1) advising all parents that reading aloud with young children
can enhance parent-child relationships and prepare young minds to learn language and early literacy skills; (2) counseling all parents about developmentally
appropriate shared-reading activities that are enjoyable for children and their parents and offer language-rich exposure to books, pictures, and the written word; (3) providing developmentally appropriate books given at health supervision visits for all high-risk, low-income young children; (4) using a robust spectrum of options to support and promote these efforts; and (5) partnering with other child advocates to influence national messaging and policies that support and promote these key early shared-reading experiences. The AAP supports federal
and state funding for children's books to be provided at pediatric health supervision visits to children at high risk living at or near the poverty threshold and the integration of literacy promotion, an essential component of pediatric primary care, into pediatric resident education. This policy statement is supported by the AAP technical report ``School Readiness'' and supports the AAP policy statement ``Early Childhood
Adversity, Toxic Stress, and the Role of the Pediatrician: Translating Developmental Science Into Lifelong Health.''},

@article{bernard_children_2015,
	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate how 3- to 5-year-old children (N = 150) identify an object when they are confronted with conflicting evidence, notably when the available perceptual evidence is contradicted by the testimony of either a lone informant or a three-informant consensus. Results showed that (a) 5-year-olds were more likely than 3- or 4-year-olds to rely on the perceptual evidence, ignoring claims made by the informants; (b) the three informant consensus had more impact than a single informant for all age groups; and (c) children were more likely to make a perception-based response if the stimulus was perceptually unambiguous rather than equivocal with respect to its identity. Moreover, when children's task was to identify equivocal stimuli, they endorsed the three-informant consensus more than the lone informant. In contrast, when they needed to identify unambiguous stimuli, the number of informants did not influence children's responses. Taken together, the results show that the tendency to resist testimony on the basis of perceptual evidence increases with age. Moreover, preschoolers monitor both the characteristics of their informants and the relative ambiguity of the perceptual stimuli when they need to weigh verbal testimony against perceptual evidence.},

@article{benson_individual_nodate,
	Abstract = {Twenty-four 3.5-year-old children who initially showed poor performance on false-belief tasks participated in a training protocol designed to promote performance on these tasks. Our aim was to determine whether the extent to which children benefited from training was predicted by their performance on a battery of executive functioning tasks. Findings indicated that individual differences in executive functioning performance strongly and consistently predicted improvement in children's false-belief performance and their ability to appropriately explain false-belief-based behavior, both during the training period and during the posttest. These findings were robust after statistically controlling for several relevant covariates. These results are consistent with the suggestion that executive functioning skills promote developments in theory of mind by facilitating the ability to reflect upon and learn from relevant experience.},

@article{bonawitz_balancing_2012,
	Abstract = {We look at the effect of evidence and prior beliefs on exploration, explanation and learning. In Experiment 1, we tested children both with and without differential prior beliefs about balance relationships (Center Theorists, mean: 82 months; Mass Theorists, mean:
89 months; No Theory children, mean: 62 months). Center and Mass Theory children who observed identical evidence explored the block differently depending on their beliefs. When the block
was balanced at its geometric center (belief-violating to a Mass Theorist, but belief-consistent to a Center Theorist), Mass Theory children explored the block more, and Center Theory children showed the standard novelty preference; when the block was balanced
at the center of mass, the pattern of results reversed. The No Theory children showed a novelty preference regardless of evidence. In Experiments 2 and 3, we follow-up on these findings, showing that both Mass and Center Theorists selectively and differentially
appeal to auxiliary variables (e.g., a magnet) to explain
evidence only when their beliefs are violated. We also show that children use the data to revise their predictions in the absence of the explanatory auxiliary variable but not in its presence. Taken
together, these results suggest that children's learning is at once conservative and flexible; children integrate evidence, prior beliefs, and competing causal hypotheses in their exploration, explanation,
and learning.},

Children are additionally organized according to their number of risk factors (from 0 - 4). These are: (1) the child lives in a single-parent household, (2) the child's mother has less than a high school education, (3) the child's household income is below the federal poverty line, and (4) the primary language spoken in the home is not English. Performance on the academic, cognitive, and behavioral measures is shown to decrease with increases in risk factors.},

@article{mcmullen2015preschool,
	Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that early natural number knowledge is a predictor of later rational number conceptual knowledge, even though students' difficulties with rational numbers have also been explained by the overuse of natural number concepts---often referred to as the natural number bias. Hannula and Lehtinen (Learn Instr 15:237--256, 2005) have shown that children's tendency to spontaneously focus on numerosity (SFON) predicts the development of natural number and arithmetic skills. The present study follows 36 children from the age of 6 years to the age of 12 years in order to determine how preschool SFON tendency and number sequence skills are related to rational number conceptual knowledge at the age of 12 years. The results show that children's SFON tendency before school age is a strong predictor of later rational numbers conceptual knowledge, even after controlling for preschool number sequence skills. This finding has implications for the understanding of how the transition from reasoning about natural number concepts to reasoning about rational numbers may be influenced by children's self-initiated practice with numbers in everyday situations.},

However, joint attention, as conventionally defined and measured, relies only on overt indicators of attention, is studied predominantly in the visual modality, and varies by culture. Moreover, word learning can occur without joint attention in typical development, in autistic development, and in Williams syndrome, and joint attention can occur without commensurate word learning in Down syndrome. Thus, the assumption that joint attention is a necessary and sufficient precursor to vocabulary learning is not universally supported.},

@article{kirby2015compression,
	Abstract = {Abstract Language exhibits striking systematic structure. Words are composed of combinations of reusable sounds, and those words in turn are combined to form complex sentences. These properties make language unique among natural communication systems and enable our species to convey an open-ended set of messages. We provide a cultural evolutionary account of the origins of this structure. We show, using simulations of rational learners and laboratory experiments, that structure arises from a trade-off between pressures for compressibility (imposed during learning) and expressivity (imposed during communication). We further demonstrate that the relative strength of these two pressures can be varied in different social contexts, leading to novel predictions about the emergence of structured behaviour in the wild. },

@article{abel2016load,
	Abstract = {Speech convergence is the tendency of talkers to become more similar to someone they are listening or talking to, whether that person is a conversational partner or merely a voice heard repeating words. To elucidate the nature of the mechanisms underlying convergence, this study uses different levels of task difficulty on speech convergence within dyads collaborating on a task. Dyad members had to build identical LEGO{\textregistered} constructions without being able to see each other's construction, and with each member having half of the instructions required to complete the construction. Three levels of task difficulty were created, with five dyads at each level (30 participants total). Task difficulty was also measured using completion time and error rate. Listeners who heard pairs of utterances from each dyad judged convergence to be occurring in the Easy condition and to a lesser extent in the Medium condition, but not in the Hard condition. Amplitude envelope acoustic similarity analyses of the same utterance pairs showed that convergence occurred in dyads with shorter completion times and lower error rates. Together, these results suggest that while speech convergence is a highly variable behavior, it may occur more in contexts of low cognitive load. The relevance of these results for the current automatic and socially-driven models of convergence is discussed. },

Speakers also tend to overestimate how effective they are, believing that their message is understood more often than it really is. Together, these findings suggest a systematic cause for miscommunication.},

The authors investigate the root reason for these expectations by comparing a cooperativeness-based account (Grice, 1975) with a simpler consistency-based account. In two eye-tracking experiments, the authors investigated the expectations underlying the effect of precedents on comprehension. The authors show that listeners expect speakers to be consistent in their use of expressions even when these expectations cannot be motivated by the assumption of cooperativeness. The authors conclude that though this phenomenon seems to be motivated by cooperativeness, listeners' expectation that speakers be consistent in their use of expressions is governed by a general expectation of consistency.},

@article{lane2008speaker,
	Abstract = {To what extent do speaker-external communicative pressures versus speaker-internal cognitive pressures affect utterance form? Four experiments measured speakers' references to privately known (i.e., privileged) objects when naming mutually known (i.e., common ground) objects. Although speaker-external communicative pressures demanded that speakers avoid references to privileged objects, 2 experiments showed that speakers often ignored this demand when it coexisted with a speaker-internal pressure to attend to those privileged objects. The authors hypothesize that this was due to increased salience of privileged objects (a speaker-internal pressure). Experiment 3 showed that directly boosting the salience of privileged objects increased the likelihood that speakers will inappropriately refer to those objects. Experiment 4 showed that the salience-sensitive mechanism in Experiments 1 and 2 is likely related to the mechanism causing such references in Experiment 3. Thus, the language production system is especially sensitive to cognitive pressures even when communicative harm results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

All experiments were concerned with the way in which speakers choose between syntactic forms with very similar meanings. Theories of dialogue assume that speakers address their contributions directly to their addressees, but also indirectly to side participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, speakers produced picture descriptions that had the same syntactic structure as a previous speaker's descriptions which had been addressed to a third person. This indicated that syntactic alignment is not limited to speaker-addressee dyads. However, the prior participant role of the current speaker affected alignment: prior addressees aligned more than prior side-participants. In contrast, Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that alignment was unaffected by the prior participant role of the current addressee. We interpret these findings in terms of depth of processing during encoding.},

Previous research has demonstrated that ease of production plays a role in speakers' syntactic choices, but that ease of comprehension does not. However, such studies have not employed dialogues that involve role swapping on a turn-by-turn basis. In our experiment, participants alternated in giving and following instructions to move objects around on a grid. They tended to repeat the syntactic form just used by their interlocutor, reflecting sensitivity to ease of production. More interestingly, they were more likely to disambiguate their utterances when the visual context was potentially ambiguous than when it was not, reflecting sensitivity to ease of comprehension. We conclude that speakers pay attention to their beliefs about their addressees' ease of comprehension, in addition to considering ease of production for themselves. },

@article{lockridge2002addressees,
	Abstract = {A current debate in psycholinguistics concerns how speakers take addressees' knowledge or needs into account during the packaging of utterances. In retelling stories, speakers are more likely to mention atypical instruments than easily inferrable, typical instruments; in a seminal study, Brown and Dell (1987) suggested that this is not an adjustment to addressees but is simply easiest for speakers. They concluded that manipulating addressees' knowledge did not affect speakers' mention of instruments. However, their addressees were confederates who heard the same stories repeatedly. We had speakers retell stories to naive addressees who either saw or did not see a picture illustrating the main action and instrument. When addressees lacked pictures, speakers were more likely to mention atypical instruments, to mention them early (within the same clause as the action verb), and to mark atypical instruments as indefinite. This suggests that with visual copresence, speakers can take addressees' knowledge into account in early syntactic choices.},

	Abstract = {Language use can be viewed as a form of joint activity that requires the coordination of meaning
between individuals. Because the linguistic signal is notoriously ambiguous, interlocutors
need to draw upon additional sources of information to resolve ambiguity and achieve shared
understanding. One way individuals can achieve coordination is by using inferences about the
interlocutor's intentions and mental states to adapt their behavior. However, such an inferential
process can be demanding in terms of both time and cognitive resources. Here, we suggest that
interaction provides interlocutors with many cues that can support coordination of meaning, even when they are neither produced intentionally for that purpose nor interpreted as signaling speakers' intention. In many circumstances, interlocutors can take advantage of these cues to adapt their behavior in ways that promote coordination, bypassing the need to resort to deliberative inferential processes.},

Speakers might use more acoustically prominent words for distracted addressees, to ensure that important information is communicated. Alternatively, speakers might disengage from the task and use less prominent pronunciations with distracted addressees. A further question is whether prosodic prominence changes globally or if there are effects specific to the most relevant information. We studied these effects in two instruction-giving experiments. Speakers instructed listeners to move objects to locations on a board. In the distraction condition, addressees were also completing a demanding secondary computer task; in the attentive condition they paid full attention. Results demonstrated that speakers modify their speech for distracted listeners, and in an instruction-giving task they specifically use more acoustically prominent (longer) pronunciations for distracted listeners.

and simplified referring expressions. Articulation results replicate Bard et al. (2000),
depending only on what the speaker has heard. Change between mentions was no greater when it could be inferred that the listener could see the named item (Expt 1), and no less when the listener explicitly denied ability to do so (Expt 2). Word duration fell for speaker- Given listener-New items (Expt 3). Reduction was unaffected by the repeater's ability to see the mentioned landmark (Expt 4). In contrast, referential form was more sensitive to both listener- (Expt 3) and speaker- knowledge (Expt 4). The results conform most closely to a Dual Process model: fast, automatic, processes let the speaker-knowledge prime word articulation, while costly assessments of listener-knowledge influence only referential form.},

	Abstract = {The current study investigates the influence of lexical factors on phonetic
convergence and explores the relationship between acoustic and perceptual measures of convergence. A set of talkers produced baseline and shadowed tokens of target words that varied in frequency and phonological neighbor density independently. Experiment 1 demonstrated the impact of lexical factors on vowel dispersion in speech production. In Experiment 2, separate listeners judged the relative similarity of shadowed to model tokens in an AXB perceptual test of phonetic convergence. Acoustic measures of inter- talker distances in duration, fundamental frequency, and vowel formants for baseline and shadowed speech were compared to the perceptual measures. A mixed-effects regression model using a combination of acoustic convergence measures predicted perceived phonetic convergence better than lexical factors or individual acoustic attributes alone. These findings have important methodological and theoretical implications for understanding the complexities of phonetic convergence. Studies of convergence should consider examining acoustic and perceptual measures in tandem. Lexical factors impact speech production and perception, but their effects appear to be independent of those that evoke phonetic convergence.},

All these forms of behavioral matching have been hypothesized to play a supportive role in establishing coordination and common ground between interlocutors. In the present study, evidence is found for a new kind of coordination termed complexity matching. Temporal dynamics in conversational speech signals were analyzed through time series of acoustic onset events. Timing in periods of acoustic energy was found to exhibit behavioral matching that reflects complementary timing in turn-taking. In addition, acoustic onset times were found to exhibit power law clustering across a range of timescales, and these power law functions were found to exhibit complexity matching that is distinct from behavioral matching. Complexity matching is discussed in terms of interactive alignment and other theoretical principles that lead to new hypotheses about information exchange in dyadic conversation and interaction in general.},

A variety of existing alignment measures is used and applied to our data. In particular, a windowed cross-correlation procedure, that has been used previously in visual behavior research, is applied to prosodic features. In addition, we address the issue of how to separate genuine observed alignment from alignment that is a result from random coincidental behavior. Using these measures, we find some indications of prosodic convergence and synchrony in the map task conversations. Alignment tendencies are strongest for intensity, and familiarity seems to play a role in convergence. Finally, weak evidence was found for a correlation between prosodic alignment measures and task success.},

Forty interviewers (ERs), undergraduates enrolled in a class on interviewing processes, conducted 20--30 minute interviews with selected interviewees (EEs), business persons and professionals in fields of interest to the ERs. Speech behaviors examined included response latency, speech rate, and turn duration; these were coded per one minute intervals of each interaction. Time series regression procedures indicated that both ERs and EEs converged speech rate and response latency toward their interlocutors' performances of these behaviors. Although turn duration convergence did not characterize the entire data set, male-male dyads did converge significantly and male (ER)-female (EE) dyads significantly diverged turn duration. Regarding speech evaluation, there was some evidence that greater response latency similarity, greater speech rate and response latency convergence, and faster ER speech and slower EE speech were positively related to the competence and social attractiveness judgments of participants. Limitations and implications are discussed.},

	Abstract = {When people talk, they tend to adopt the behaviors, gestures,
and language of their conversational partners. This
``accommodation'' to one's partners is largely automatic, but
the degree to which it occurs is influenced by social factors,
such as gender, relative power, and attraction. In settings
where such social information is not known, this accommodation
can be a useful cue for the missing information. This
is especially important in web-based communication, where
social dynamics are often fluid and rarely stated explicitly.
But connecting accommodation and social dynamics on the
web requires accurate quantification of the di↵erent amounts
of accommodation being made.
We focus specifically on accommodation in the form of
``linguistic alignment'': the amount that one person's word
use is influenced by another's. Previous studies have used
many measures for linguistic alignment, with no clear standard.
In this paper, we lay out a set of desiderata for a
linguistic alignment measure, including robustness to sparse
and short messages, explicit conditionality, and consistency
across linguistic features with di↵erent baseline frequencies.
We propose a straightforward and flexible model-based framework
for calculating linguistic alignment, with a focus on
the sparse data and limited social information observed in
social media. We show that this alignment measure fulfills
our desiderata on simulated data. We then analyze a large
corpus of Twitter data, both replicating previous results and
extending them: Our measure's improved resolution reveals
a previously undetectable e↵ect of interpersonal power in
Twitter interactions.},

	Abstract = {The style dimension of language variation has not been adequately ex- plained in sociolinguistic theory. Stylistic or intraspeaker variation derives from and mirrors interspeaker variation. Style is essentially speakers' re- sponse to their audience. In audience design, speakers accommodate pri- marily to their addressee. Third persons - auditors and overhearers - affect style to a lesser but regular degree. Audience design also accounts for bilingual or bidialectal code choices. Nonaudience factors like topic and setting derive their effect by association with addressee types. These style shifts are mainly responsive - caused by a situational change. Speakers can also use style as initiative, to redefine the existing situation. Initiative style is primarily referee design: divergence from the addressee and towards an absent reference group. Referee design is especially prevalent in mass com- munication.

We build on a recent probabilis-tic model of alignment, using it to separate out alignment attributable to words versus word categories. We model alignment in two contexts: telephone conversations and microblog replies. Our results show evidence of alignment, but it is primarily lexical rather than categorical.

@article{kleinschmidt2015robust,
	Abstract = {Successful speech perception requires that listeners map the acoustic signal to linguistic categories. These mappings are not only probabilistic, but change depending on the situation. For example, one talker's /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker's /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively nonstationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (a) recognizing previously encountered situations, (b) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (c) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (a) to (c) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on 2 critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires that listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these 2 aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.},

@article{kraljic2005prosodic,
	Abstract = {Evidence has been mixed on whether speakers spontaneously and reliably produce prosodic cues that resolve syntactic ambiguities. And when speakers do produce such cues, it is unclear whether they do so "for" their addressees (the audience design hypothesis) or "for" themselves, as a by-product of planning and articulating utterances. Three experiments addressed these issues. In Experiments 1 and 3, speakers followed pictorial guides to spontaneously instruct addressees to move objects. Critical instructions (e.g., "Put the dog in the basket on the star") were syntactically ambiguous, and the referential situation supported either one or both interpretations. Speakers reliably produced disambiguating cues to syntactic ambiguity whether the situation was ambiguous or not. However, Experiment 2 suggested that most speakers were not yet aware of whether the situation was ambiguous by the time they began to speak, and so adapting to addressees' particular needs may not have been feasible in Experiment 1. Experiment 3 examined individual speakers' awareness of situational ambiguity and the extent to which they signaled structure, with or without addressees present. Speakers tended to produce prosodic cues to syntactic boundaries regardless of their addressees' needs in particular situations. Such cues did prove helpful to addressees, who correctly interpreted speakers' instructions virtually all the time. In fact, even when speakers produced syntactically ambiguous utterances in situations that supported both interpretations, eye-tracking data showed that 40% of the time addressees did not even consider the non-intended objects. We discuss the standards needed for a convincing test of the audience design hypothesis. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Between-talker repetitions of the same lexical items produced in a conversational task were examined for phonetic convergence by asking a separate set of listeners to detect similarity in pronunciation across items in a perceptual task. In general, a listener judged a repeated item spoken by one talker in the task to be more similar to a sample production spoken by the talker's partner than corresponding pre-and postinteraction utterances. Both the role of a participant in the task and the sex of the pair of talkers affected the degree of convergence.

	Abstract = {Speakers only sometimes include the that in sentence complement structures like The coach knew (that) you missed practice. Six experiments tested the predictions concerning optional word mention of two general approaches to language production. One approach claims that language production processes choose syntactic structures that ease the task of creating sentences, so that words are spoken opportunistically, as they are selected for production. The second approach claims that a syntactic structure is chosen that is easiest to comprehend, so that optional words like that are used to avoid temporarily ambiguous, difficult-to-comprehend sentences. In all experiments, speakers did not consistently include optional words to circumvent a temporary ambiguity, but they did omit optional words (the complementizer that) when subsequent material was either repeated (within a sentence) or prompted with a recall cue. The results suggest that speakers choose syntactic structures to permit early mention of available material and not to circumvent disruptive temporary ambiguities.},

	Abstract = {Pickering and Garrod (2004) argued that alignment is the basis of successful communication in dialogue. In other words, successful communication goes hand-in-hand with the development of similar representations in the interlocutors. But what exactly does this mean? In this paper, we attempt to define alignment, contrasting alignment of situa- tion models with alignment of linguistic representations. We then speculate on how these notions are related and why they lead to conversational success.},

@article{branigan2000syntactic,
	Abstract = {There is substantial evidence that speakers co-ordinate their contributions in dialogue. Until now, experimental studies of co-ordination have concentrated on the development of shared strategies for reference. We present an experiment that employed a novel confederate-scripting technique to investigate whether speakers also co-ordinate syntactic structure in dialogue. Pairs of speakers took it in turns to describe pictures to each other. One speaker was a confederate of the experimenter and produced scripted descriptions that systematically varied in syntactic structure. The syntactic structure of the confederate's description affected the syntactic structure of the other speaker's subsequent description. We suggest that these effects are instances of syntactic priming (Bock, 1986), and provide evidence for a shared level of representation in comprehension and production. We describe how these effects might be realized in a processing model of language production, and relate them to previous findings of linguistic co-ordination in dialogue. },

@article{horton2005conversational,
	Abstract = { Speakers in conversation routinely engage in audience design. That is, they construct their utterances to be understood by particular addressees. Standard accounts of audience design have frequently appealed to the notion of common ground. On this view, speakers produce well-designed utterances by expressly considering the knowledge they take as shared with addressees. This article suggests that conversational common ground, rather than being a category of specialized mental representations, is more usefully conceptualized as an emergent property of ordinary memory processes. This article examines 2 separate but equally important processes: commonality assessment and message formation. Commonality assessment involves the retrieval of memory traces concerning what information is shared with an addressee, whereas message formation involves deciding how to use that information in conversation. Evidence from the CallHome English corpus of telephone conversations shows how each of these processes is rooted in basic aspects of human memory. The overall goal of this article is to demonstrate the need for a more cognitive psychological account of conversational common ground. },

@article{rosa2015effects,
	Abstract = { How do speakers accommodate distracted listeners? Specifically, how does prosody change when speakers know that their addressees are multitasking? Speakers might use more acoustically prominent words for distracted addressees, to ensure that important information is communicated. Alternatively, speakers might disengage from the task and use less prominent pronunciations with distracted addressees. A further question is whether prosodic prominence changes globally or if there are effects specific to the most relevant information. We studied these effects in two instruction-giving experiments. Speakers instructed listeners to move objects to locations on a board. In the distraction condition, addressees were also completing a demanding secondary computer task; in the attentive condition they paid full attention. Results demonstrated that speakers modify their speech for distracted listeners, and in an instruction-giving task they specifically use more acoustically prominent (longer) pronunciations for distracted listeners. This effect was localised to the most task-relevant information: the object to be moved. },

@article{dautriche2017words,
	Abstract = {Abstract Recent evidence suggests that cognitive pressures associated with language acquisition and use could affect the organization of the lexicon. On one hand, consistent with noisy channel models of language (e.g., Levy, 2008), the phonological distance between wordforms should be maximized to avoid perceptual confusability (a pressure for dispersion). On the other hand, a lexicon with high phonological regularity would be simpler to learn, remember and produce (e.g., Monaghan et al., 2011) (a pressure for clumpiness). Here we investigate wordform similarity in the lexicon, using measures of word distance (e.g., phonological neighborhood density) to ask whether there is evidence for dispersion or clumpiness of wordforms in the lexicon. We develop a novel method to compare lexicons to phonotactically-controlled baselines that provide a null hypothesis for how clumpy or sparse wordforms would be as the result of only phonotactics. Results for four languages, Dutch, English, German and French, show that the space of monomorphemic wordforms is clumpier than what would be expected by the best chance model according to a wide variety of measures: minimal pairs, average Levenshtein distance and several network properties. This suggests a fundamental drive for regularity in the lexicon that conflicts with the pressure for words to be as phonologically distinct as possible. },

@inproceedings{yurovsky2016tuned,
	Abstract = {Children rapidly learn a tremendous amount about language despite limitations imposed on them by their developing cog- nitive abilities. One possible explanation for this rapid learn- ing is that caregivers tune the language they produce to these limitations, titrating the complexity of their speech to developmentally-appropriate levels. We test this hypothesis in a large-scale corpus analysis, measuring the contingency between parents' and children's speech over the first 5 years. Our results support the linguistic tuning hypothesis, showing a high degree of mostly parent-led coordination early in development that decreases as children become more proficient language learners and users.},

	Abstract = {Reading picture books to pre-literate children is associated with improved language outcomes, but the causal pathways of this relationship are not well understood. The present analyses focus on several syntactic differences between the text of children's picture books and typical child-directed speech, with the aim of understanding ways in which picture book text may systematically differ from typical child-directed speech. The analyses show that picture books contain more rare and complex sentence types, including passive sentences and sentences containing relative clauses, than does child-directed speech. These differences in the patterns of language contained in picture books and typical child-directed speech suggest that one important means by which picture book reading may come to be associated with improved language outcomes is by providing children with types of complex language that might be otherwise rare in their input.},

	Abstract = {There are large racial disparities in school discipline in the United States, which, for Black students, not only contribute to school failure but also can lay a path toward incarceration. Although the disparities have been well documented, the psychological mechanisms underlying them are unclear. In two experiments, we tested the hypothesis that such disparities are, in part, driven by racial stereotypes that can lead teachers to escalate their negative responses to Black students over the course of multiple interpersonal (e.g., teacher-to-student) encounters. More generally, we argue that race not only can influence how perceivers interpret a specific behavior, but also can enhance perceivers' detection of behavioral patterns across time. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical benefits of employing this novel approach to stereotyping across a range of real-world settings.},

	Abstract = {Growing suspension rates predict major negative life outcomes, including adult incarceration and unemployment. Experiment 1 tested whether teachers (n = 39) could be encouraged to adopt an empathic rather than punitive mindset about discipline-to value students' perspectives and sustain positive relationships while encouraging better behavior. Experiment 2 tested whether an empathic response to misbehavior would sustain students' (n = 302) respect for teachers and motivation to behave well in class. These hypotheses were confirmed. Finally, a randomized field experiment tested a brief, online intervention to encourage teachers to adopt an empathic mindset about discipline. Evaluated at five middle schools in three districts (Nteachers = 31; Nstudents = 1,682), this intervention halved year-long student suspension rates from 9.6{\%} to 4.8{\%}. It also bolstered respect the most at-risk students, previously suspended students, perceived from teachers. Teachers' mindsets about discipline directly affect the quality of teacher-student relationships and student suspensions and, moreover, can be changed through scalable intervention.},

@article{Tomasello1992,
	Abstract = {A language is composed of conventional symbols shaped by their social-communicative functions. Children acquire these symbols, both lexical and syntactic, in the context of culturally constituted event structures that make salient these functions. In the acquisition process children rely on cultural learning skills (i.e., imitative learning). These skills emanate from their ability to participate intersubjectively with adults in cultural activities (i.e., joint attention), which underlies their ability to understand the ways adults are using particular pieces of language. The development of communicative competence as a whole, including not only lexical and syntactic skills but also various pragmatic skills, depends largely on feedback about communicative efficacy that children receive from different interactants. This feedback is used by children to make further inferences about the conventional functional significance of particular linguistic expressions. This social-pragmatic view of language acquisition obviates the need for a priori, specifically linguistic, format constraints on the language acquisition process.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to begin to characterize and compare the school and home language environments of 10 preschool-aged children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Naturalistic language samples were collected from each child, utilizing Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) digital voice recorder technology, at 3-month intervals over the course of one year. LENA software was used to identify 15-min segments of each sample that represented the highest number of adult words used during interactions with each child for all school and home language samples. Selected segments were transcribed and analyzed using Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT). LENA data was utilized to evaluate quantitative characteristics of the school and home language environments and SALT data was utilized to evaluate quantitative and qualitative characteristics of language environment. Results revealed many similarities in home and school language environments including the degree of semantic richness, and complexity of adult language, types of utterances, and pragmatic functions of utterances used by adults during interactions with child participants. Study implications and recommendations for future research are discussed. Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to, (1) describe how two language sampling technologies can be utilized together to collect and analyze language samples, (2) describe characteristics of the school and home language environments of young children with ASD, and (3) identify environmental factors that may lead to more positive expressive language outcomes of young children with ASD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {The ability to use language to refer to people and things is one of the most basic skills that human children must acquire in the first years of life. How they learn to do this given their limited cognitive resources and how the learning process varies across languages is one of the great puzzles of acquisition research. From this perspective, personal pronouns are a particularly interesting case study. Not only are pronouns extremely common cross-linguistically, but understanding what they refer to hinges on the ability to integrate information from multiple sources. Consider the interpretation of she in (1) below. The child must extract the pronoun-internal cues of gender, number, and person in order to begin the search for an appropriate antecedent. Often, however, more than one such antecedent exists (ex. Maria, Ana), and the child must therefore also extract information from pronoun-or even sentence-external sources to decide among these antecedents. (1) Maria greeted Ana and Juan. Now she is leaving. Studies on adult pronoun resolution have identified a large number of discourse factors that raise the salience of certain antecedents over others. All else being equal, adults show a preference for antecedents that are mentioned first (J{\"{a}}rvikivi et al. 2005, Arnold et al. 2007), agentive (Pykkonen {\&} Jarvikivi 2010), introduced in subject position (Gordon et al. 1993, a.o) and fulfilling a parallel grammatical function to the pronoun (Smyth 1994, Chambers {\&} Smyth 1998). Pronominal form also matters, as the more reduced a referring expression is (ex. unstressed pronouns, null pronouns, clitics) the stronger its tendency to pick out a highly salient antecedent (Gundel et al. 1993, Ariel 2001, Carminati 2002, Alonso-Ovalle et al. 2010). These discourse-level, probabilistic cues contrast sharply with the more statistically reliable, pronoun-internal grammatical cues of person, number, and gender, yet both cue types are necessary for interpretation. Therefore, we ask the question: How do children learn to integrate grammatical and discourse cues together in order to interpret pronouns?},

	Abstract = {In many cognitive domains, learning is more effective when exemplars are distributed over a number of sessions than when they are all presented within one session. The present study investigated this distributed learning effect with respect to English-speaking children's acquisition of a complex grammatical construction. Forty-eight children aged 3;6-5;10 (Experiment 1) and 72 children aged 4;0-5;0 (Experiment 2) were given 10 exposures to the construction all in one session (massed), or on a schedule of two trials per day for 5 days (distributed-pairs), or one trial per day for 10 days (distributed). Children in both the distributed-pairs and distributed conditions learnt the construction better than children in the massed condition, as evidenced by productive use of this construction with a verb that had not been presented during training. Methodological and theoretical implications of this finding are discussed, with particular reference to single-process accounts of language acquisition. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Tully2015,
	Abstract = {Consumers with limited discretionary money face important trade-offs when deciding how to spend it. In the current research, we suggest that feelings of financial constraint increase consumers' concern about the lasting utility of their purchases, which in turn increases their preference for material goods over experiences. The results of seven studies confirm that the consideration of financial constraints shifts consumers' preferences toward material goods (rather than experiences), and that this systematic shift is due to an increased concern about the longevity of the purchase. This preference shift persists even when the material goods are more frivolous than the experiences, indicating that the effect is not driven by an increased desire for sensible and justifiable purchases. However, the shift toward material purchases disappears when the material good is unusually short lived, further implicating concern about longevity as the key driver of the effect. Finally, the consideration of financial constraints increases preference for material purchases even when the potential memories that experiences can provide are made explicitly salient. Together, these results indicate that financially constrained consumers spend their discretionary money on material purchases as a means of securing long-term consumption utility.},

Results from a series of lab experiments suggested that (1) various forms of scarcity have similar effects on cognition and behavior, (2) scarcity leads to attentional shifts and greater focus (3) scarcity can lead people to over-borrow, and (4) scarcity can lead to cognitive fatigue. Camerer (2018) recently conducted replications of studies from a set of social science papers, and failed to replicate the result on cognitive fatigue from Shah et al. (2012). In this paper, we present high-powered replications of all studies from Shah et al. (2012). We describe which results appear more robust and which results appear to be less robust.

	Abstract = {Children vary greatly in the number of words they know when they enter school, a major factor influencing subsequent school and workplace success. This variability is partially explained by the differential quantity of parental speech to preschoolers. However, the contexts in which young learners hear new words are also likely to vary in referential transparency; that is, in how clearly word meaning can be inferred from the immediate extralinguistic context, an aspect of input quality. To examine this aspect, we asked 218 adult participants to guess 50 parents{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} words from (muted) videos of their interactions with their 14- to 18-mo-old children. We found systematic differences in how easily individual parents{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} words could be identified purely from this socio-visual context. Differences in this kind of input quality correlated with the size of the children{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s vocabulary 3 y later, even after controlling for differences in input quantity. Although input quantity differed as a function of socioeconomic status, input quality (as here measured) did not, suggesting that the quality of nonverbal cues to word meaning that parents offer to their children is an individual matter, widely distributed across the population of parents.},

	Abstract = {Literate societies generally treat language as an autonomous system with its distinct history and tradition. Speech activity, however, as an ongoing process responding to a variety of com- munication settings, is as much a product of environment as of tradition. The study attempts to understand the ecology of language in the Indian subcontinent, marked by the plurality of cultures and communication patterns in one space. The Indian geography of language plurality provides some glimpses of the speech communi- cation patterns in the subcontinent through the characteristics such as: (i) fuzziness of language boundaries; (ii) fluidity in language identity; (iii) identity claims vs language communications; and (iv) complementarity of intra-group and inter-group communications. This phenomenon is identified as a case of organic pluralism, in contrast with the structural pluralism that prevail in many multilingual countries of Europe. In this context, the paper probes into the traditional Indian concept of kshetra `the region' which presents a sense of collective reality in midst of a wide spectrum of linguistic and cultural variation in everyday life.},

@article{dautriche2016wordform,
	Annote = {- words that need to be communicated about more frequently tend to be short, predictable, and simple
- clusters of phon forms that may convey advantage for learning, memory, and lex retrieval
- learning similarities among referents (and hence forming semantic categories) may be facilitated if these similarities appear at the level of the wordform --{\textgreater} predicts phon similar words tend to be more semantically similar
- lang evo in lab leads to lexicons where single wordform tends to be reused to express several meanings (making lang easier to learn)
- communication = transfer of info over noisy channel, successful = listerners able to recover what is being said (implies word confusability should be minimized)
- set of possible words for given context should be maximally distinct in order to be recognized accurately
- toddlers find difficult to learn words that are both phonologically and semantically similar
- info theory predicts that semantically related words more distant in phonological space than unrelated words

Is there a relationship between semantic distance and phonological distance?
if positive, implies pressure for phon clustering tied specifically to meaning
if negative, pressure for meanings to be more distinct relative to phon distance, due to comm pressures of confusability
- previous results with two langs can't tell us if regularities result of universally applying learnability pressure or historical accidents
- LSA to calculate semantic similarity - words meanings can be inferred from their context, context is a bag of words - semantically similar if patterns of cooccurrence similar (advantage that can use for any language with sufficiently large corpus, don't need to code meanings)
- orthographic similarity as proxy for wordform (correlated with number of phonemes in Dutch, English, German, and French)

100 orthographic lexicons from Wikipedia
- lexicon = 5,000 most frequent wordforms in corpus
- only compare words of the same length (to avoid comparing cat to cats or big to biggest)
- used phonemic lexicons for four languages: Dutch, English, German, French, restricting to monomorphemic lemmas 
- when several words shared same phonemic form (e.g., bat), included form only once {\textless}--?

LSA
Gensim package - splits wiki corpus into docs with n lines of text, constructs word-document matrix where each row is a word and each column is a document
each cell corresponds to freq of word i in doc j
Singular Value Decomposition: matrix reduced to dimension d corresponding to number of semantic dimensions of the model
semantic distance is distance in that d-dimensional space
documents are wikipedia articles
d= 500 dimensions
throw out words that appear in {\textless}=20 docs, and words that appear in {\textgreater} 50{\%} of docs

Pearson correlations between same-length (3-7 characters) pairs semantic and phonological distances 
compare to randomly permuted baseline - mapping between form and meaning entirely arbitrary for words of each given length
random permutation 10,000 times

Results
all corrs positive
most significant
--{\textgreater} as sem distance increases, ortho distance does too
very very small effects - less than .05 of variance

To control for variation among lang families, mixed effect regression predicting sem dist for each word pair from edit distance

To make sure not just driven by pockets of sound-symbolic words, looked at relationship between semantic relatedness and likelihood of finding minimal pair
compared number of minimal pairs in top 10{\%} of sem related words and bottom 10{\%} of sem related words, and made into ratio: ntop/nbottom
- below 1 means more minimal pairs in semantically unrelated words
- above 1 more minimal pairs in semantically related words than unrelated words
--{\textgreater} in all 100 langs, minimal pairs 3.52 times more likely to appear in top 10{\%} than bottom 10{\%}, effect present even changing to to/bottom 25{\%}, and at all word lengths

average corr found among monosyllabic words smaller (.02 compared to .04), but more than expected by chance, so conclude morph similarity not driving effects

open question the extent to which morphology, and its interaction with orthography, contribute to the observed correlations from the Wikipedia corpora

sound-symbolism might be cog'ly grounded
Monaghan et al. (2014) showed that the first words acquired by children display more sound symbolism than later acquired words, suggesting that there may be a natural propensity to establish a cross-modal relation between form and meaning

systematic form-meaning mappings may be helpful during lan- guage learning to cue grammatical categories and support generalization to novel words

reg- ularities in the lexicon may minimize memory load by reusing similar codes and mapping them onto similar meanings, yielding lexical systems which are simpler thus easier to learn and more likely to survive the language transmission process (Brighton, Kirby, {\&} Smith, 2005)
- results not consistent with the predictions of communication-based influences on lexical structure
-noise in the speech signal may not exert a selection pressure on form-meaning mappings in languages. Indeed, context is typically sufficient to disambiguate between meanings, since adult speakers use many cues when processing spoken sentences
- finer-grained contextual information may be sufficient most of the time for language understanding and learning to distinguish between phonologically similar words.
- but if noise in signal doesn't matter, unclear how to explain why speakers mod production to transmit a uniform amt of info per unit of time (UID)
-effect of communicative efficiency may be masked by other (functional) constraints on the lexicon: e.g., Finer-grained analyses suggest indeed that different phonological features may have different purposes: Tamariz (2008) shows that, in Spanish, the consonant structure of words tends to reflect systematicity of form-meaning mappings, while the vowel structure, on the contrary, shows the reverse correlation. This suggests that it is possible to achieve a trade-off between systematicity of the vocabulary and accurate word recognition

"Because the correlation between phonological and semantic similarity is found across a wide array of typologically different languages, we propose that this pattern is the result of a functional pressure that universally applies (In the early stages of word learning, having a non-arbitrary mapping between forms and meaning may be helpful to establish the mapping between the phonological and the semantic level.). Certainly, a direct causal link between any functional pressure and the pattern of systematicity found in lexicons cannot be established with the present data, neither how such a pattern may arise in the lexicon. Research on language evolution offers a promising direction toward answering these questions: Processes of repeated language transmission have been shown to turn an arbitrary lexicon into a systematic one (e.g., Kirby et al., 2008) such that the optimal structure of the vocabulary may be one that incorporates form-meaning regularities at the large scale of the lexicon as new words are added and old ones dropped through the transmission of the lexical system."},

	Abstract = {Early language exposure is essential to developing a formal language system, but may not be sufficient for communicating effectively. To understand a speaker's intention, one must take the speaker's perspective. Multilingual exposure may promote effective communication by enhancing perspective taking. We tested children on a task that required perspective taking to interpret a speaker's intended meaning. Monolingual children failed to interpret the speaker's meaning dramatically more often than both bilingual children and children who were exposed to a multilingual environment but were not bilingual themselves. Children who were merely exposed to a second language performed as well as bilingual children, despite having lower executive-function scores. Thus, the communicative advantages demonstrated by the bilinguals may be social in origin, and not due to enhanced executive control. For millennia, multilingual exposure has been the norm. Our study shows that such an environment may facilitate the development of perspective-taking tools that are critical for effective communication.},

@article{Beavers2010,
	Abstract = {This article explores the architecture of the interface between morphosyntax and lexical semantics, in particular the semantic underpinnings of argument realization. Many theories of lexical meaning assume that argument realization is derived from underlying event structure: the relative prominence of coarguments in a clause follows from their relative semantic prominence in how the event unfolds. I show that event structure is not sufficient to capture certain generalizations about argument realization, however, focusing on arguments that alternate between direct and oblique realization. I show that for these alternations the relevant semantic contrast is in strength of truth conditions: direct realization encodes a monotonically stronger set of truth conditions associated with the alternating argument than oblique realization. This, I suggest, follows if word meanings are built from basic units that are related to one another implicationally, and the relative implicational strength of such components figures into argument realization. I use as a case study English locative and conative alternations, which, I argue, reflect stronger and weaker degrees of affectedness along an independently motivated AFFECTEDNESS HIERARCHY. I also show that similar contrasts are found with other alternations on other hierarchies. I conclude by suggesting that a theory of weakening truth conditions is not incompatible with event-structural analyses of verb meaning, and in fact the two augment one another.*},

	Abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that curiosity contributes to creative performance. However, empirical work linking curiosity to creativity is surprisingly lacking. To fill this gap, this study examines the effect of trait epistemic curiosity on the creative problem solving process. Participants (N = 122) responded to questionnaires assessing trait curiosity before performing in a low-fidelity simulation in which they were tasked with solving a complex marketing problem. The quality and originality of the creative solutions were then rated by three independent coders. Results revealed that diversive curiosity (i.e., epistemic curiosity associated with interest factors) had a positive influence on creative performance---an effect that was fully mediated by information seeking behavior during early-stage creative problem solving. Furthermore, diversive curiosity positively predicted ratings of both solution quality and originality beyond established predictors of creative performance (gender, personality, domain expertise, and GMA) and constructs conceptually similar to curiosity (epistemic openness to experience, need for cognition, and typical intellectual engagement). Specific curiosity (i.e., curiosity associated with deprivation factors) was unrelated to both creative problem solving and creative performance. Implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed.},

Here we explored whether such modality constraints also affect implicit statistical learning in an artificial grammar learning task. Participants were exposed to statistically governed input sequences and then tested on their ability to classify novel items. We explored three types of presentation formats*visual input distributed spatially, visual input distributed temporally, auditory input distributed temporally*and two rates of presentation: moderate (4 elements/second) and fast (8 elements/second). Overall, learning abilities were best for visual-spatial and auditory input. Additionally, at the faster presentation rate, performance declined only for the visual-temporal condition. Finally, auditory learning was mediated by increased sensitivity to the endings of input sequences, whereas vision was most sensitive to the beginnings of sequences. These results suggest that statistical learning for sequential and spatial patterns proceeds differently across the visual and auditory modalities.},

@article{Markman1994,
	Abstract = {Very young children successfully acquire the vocabulary of their native language despite their limited information processing abilities. One partial explanation for children's success at the inductive problem word learning presents is that children are constrained in the kinds of hypotheses they consider as potential meanings of novel words. Three such constraints are discussed: (1) the whole-object assumption which leads children to infer that terms refer to objects as a whole rather than to their parts, substance, color, or other properties; (2) the taxonomic assumption which leads children to extend words to objects or entities of like kind; and (3) the mutual exclusivity assumption which leads children to avoid two labels for the same object. Recent evidence is reviewed suggesting that all three constraints are available to babies by the time of the naming explosion. Given the importance of word learning, children might be expected to recruit whatever sources of information they can to narrow down a word's meaning, including information provided by grammatical form class and the pragmatics of the situation. Word-learning constraints interact with these other sources of information but are also argued to be an especially useful source of information for children who have not yet mastered grammatical form class in that constraints should function as an entering wedge into language acquisition.},

	Abstract = {In many plants, including Arabidopsis, hybrids between species and subspecies encounter postfertilization barriers in which hybrid seed fail to develop, or else give rise to infertile progeny. In Arabidopsis, some of these barriers are sensitive to ploidy and to the epigenetic status of donor and recipient genomes. Recently, a role has been proposed for heterochromatin in reprogramming events that occur in reproductive cells, as well as in the embryo and endosperm after fertilization. 21 nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) from activated transposable elements accumulate in pollen, and are translocated from companion vegetative cells into the sperm, while in the maturing seed 24 nt siRNA are primarily maternal in origin. Thus maternal and paternal genomes likely contribute differing small RNA to the zygote and to the endosperm. As heterochromatic sequences also differ radically between, and within, species, small RNA sequences will diverge in hybrids. If transposable elements in the seed are not targeted by small RNA from the pollen, or vice versa, this could lead to hybrid seed failure, in a mechanism reminiscent of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila. Heterochromatin also plays a role in apomixis and nucleolar dominance, and may utilize a similar mechanism.},

	Abstract = {How universal is human conceptual structure? The way concepts are organized in the human brain may reflect distinct features of cultural, historical, and environmental background in addition to properties universal to human cognition. Semantics, or meaning expressed through language, provides direct access to the underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously difficult to measure, let alone parameterize. Here we provide an empirical measure of semantic proximity between concepts using cross-linguistic dictionaries. Across languages carefully selected from a phylogenetically and geographically stratified sample of genera, translations of words reveal cases where a particular language uses a single polysemous word to express concepts represented by distinct words in another. We use the frequency of polysemies linking two concepts as a measure of their semantic proximity, and represent the pattern of such linkages by a weighted network. This network is highly uneven and fragmented: certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than others, and there emerge naturally interpretable clusters loosely connected to each other. Statistical analysis shows such structural properties are consistent across different language groups, largely independent of geography, environment, and literacy. It is therefore possible to conclude the conceptual structure connecting basic vocabulary studied is primarily due to universal features of human cognition and language use.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies of dyadic interaction have examined phenomena of synchronization, entrainment, align- ment, and convergence. All these forms of behavioral matching have been hypothesized to play a supportive role in establishing coordination and common ground between interlocutors. In the present study, evidence is found for a new kind of coordination termed complexity matching. Temporal dynamics in conversational speech signals were analyzed through time series of acoustic onset events. Timing in periods of acoustic energy was found to exhibit behavioral matching that reflects complementary timing in turn-taking. In addition, acoustic onset times were found to exhibit power law clustering across a range of timescales, and these power law functions were found to exhibit complexity matching that is distinct from behavioral matching. Complexity matching is discussed in terms of interactive alignment and other theoretical principles that lead to new hypotheses about information exchange in dyadic conversation and interaction in general.

	Abstract = {In this article, we examine the hypothesis that acoustic variation (e.g., reduced vs. prominent forms) results from audience design. Bard et al. (Journal of Memory and Language 42:1-22, 2000) have argued that acoustic prominence is unaffected by the speaker's estimate of addressee knowledge, using paradigms that contrast speaker and addressee knowledge. This question was tested in a novel paradigm, focusing on the effects of addressees' feedback about their understanding of the speaker's intended message. Speakers gave instructions to addressees about where to place objects (e.g., the teapot goes on red). The addressee either anticipated the object, by picking it up before the instruction, or waited for the instruction. For anticipating addressees, speakers began speaking more quickly and pronounced the word the with shorter duration, demonstrating effects of audience design. However, no effects appeared on the head noun (e.g., teapot), as measured by duration, amplitude, and perceived intelligibility. These results are consistent with a mechanism in which evidence about addressee understanding facilitates production processes, as opposed to triggering particular acoustic forms.},
	Annote = {Does variation in acoustic reduction reflect audience design?

An unresolved question is whether the variation reflects audience design. Extensive evidence has shown that speakers select linguistic forms on the basis of the knowledge, intentions, or goals of their addressee (e.g., Brennan {\&} Clark, 1996). However, the extent of addressee-oriented production is heavily debated, and some production processes proceed without reference to the addressee's knowledge (e.g., Ferreira {\&} Dell, 2000; Horton {\&} Keysar, 1996). Here we examine the role of audience design on acoustic prominence and consider how audience design relates to utterance planning.

Predictability is traditionally considered an informational property of the situation. We propose a variation of this view, whereby predictability effects are modulated by feedback from the addressee that demonstrates that he or she understands the predicted information.

manipulated whether addressee anticipated or waited for instruction

comprehension facilitation view predicts that acoustic variation will be specific to the anticipated information, e.g., target noun

production facilitation predicts listener feedback/attentiveness will affect planning regions of utterance, e.g., at onset - might highlight predictability of event, draw attention to target object, or send signal that addressee is attentive, allowing speaker to focus on message formulation

anticipating addressees evoked less information than did waiting ones - fewer words used

for anticipating addressees, speakers began speaking more quickly, produced shorter determiners, but anticipation had no effect on object word duration},

	Abstract = {Absolute linguistic universals are often justified by cross-linguistic analysis: If all observed languages exhibit a property, the property is taken to be a likely universal, perhaps specified in the cognitive or linguistic systems of language learners and users. In many cases, these patterns are then taken to motivate linguistic theory. Here, we show that cross-linguistic analysis will very rarely be able to statistically justify absolute, inviolable patterns in language. We formalize two statistical methods-frequentist and Bayesian-and show that in both it is possible to find strict linguistic universals, but that the numbers of independent languages necessary to do so is generally unachievable. This suggests that methods other than typological statistics are necessary to establish absolute properties of human language, and thus that many of the purported universals in linguistics have not received sufficient empirical justification.},

The first goal was to track developmental changes in processing efficiency in relation to vocabulary learning in this diverse sample. The second goal was to examine differences in these crucial aspects of early language development in relation to family socioeconomic status (SES). The most important findings were that significant disparities in vocabulary and language processing efficiency were already evident at 18 months between infants from higher- and lower-SES families, and by 24 months there was a 6-month gap between SES groups in processing skills critical to language development.},

	Abstract = {By 6 years, children have a sophisticated adult-like theory of mind that enables them not only to understand the actions of social agents in terms of underlying mental states, but also to distinguish between their own mental states and those of others. Despite this, we argue that even adults do not reliably use this sophisticated ability for the very purpose for which it is designed, to interpret the actions of others. In Experiment 1, a person who played the role of "director" in a communication game instructed a participant to move certain objects around in a grid. Before receiving instructions, participants hid an object in a bag, such that they but not the director would know its identity. Occasionally, the descriptions that the director used to refer to a mutually-visible object more closely matched the identity of the object hidden in the bag. Although they clearly knew that the director did not know the identity of the hidden object, they often took it as the referent of the director's description, sometimes even attempting to comply with the instruction by actually moving the bag itself. In Experiment 2 this occurred even when the participants believed that the director had a false belief about the identity of the hidden object, i.e. that she thought that a different object was in the bag. These results show a stark dissociation between an ability to reflectively distinguish one's own beliefs from others', and the routine deployment of this ability in interpreting the actions of others. We propose that this dissociation indicates that important elements of the adult's theory of mind are not fully incorporated into the human comprehension system. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ahistorical accounts appeal only to the informativeness and availability of terms and to the current salience of the object's features. Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively. Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to. Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references. Over time, speakers simplify conceptual pacts and, when necessary, abandon them for new conceptualizations.},

Diverse activities have been shown to improve children's executive functions -- computerized training, non-computerized games, aerobics, martial arts, yoga, mindfulness, and school curricula. Central to all these is repeated practice and constantly challenging executive functions. Children with worse executive functions initially, benefit most; thus early executive-function training may avert widening achievement gaps later. To improve executive functions, focusing narrowly on them may not be as effective as also addressing emotional and social development (as do curricula that improve executive functions) and physical development (shown by positive effects of aerobics, martial arts, and yoga).},

	Abstract = {Children quickly acquire basic grammatical facts about their native language. Does this early syntactic knowledge involve knowledge of words or rules? According to lexical accounts of acquisition, abstract syntactic and semantic categories are not primitive to the language-ac- quisition system; thus, early language comprehension and production are based on verb-specific knowledge. The present experiments challenge this account:We probed the abstractness of young children's knowledge of syntax by testing whether 25- and 21-month-olds extend their knowledge of English word order to new verbs. In four experiments, children used word order appropriately to interpret transitive sentences containing novel verbs. These findings demonstrate that although toddlers have much to learn about their native languages, they represent language experience in terms of an abstract mental vo- cabulary. These abstract representations allowchildren to rapidly detect general patterns in their native language, and thus to learn rules as well as words from the start. Languages},

	Abstract = {Developmental studies have identified a strong correlation in the timing of language development and false-belief understanding. However, the nature of this relationship remains unresolved. Does language promote false-belief understanding, or does it merely facilitate development that could occur independently, albeit on a delayed timescale? We examined language development and false-belief understanding in deaf learners of an emerging sign language in Nicaragua. The use of mental-state vocabulary and performance on a low-verbal false-belief task were assessed, over 2 years, in adult and adolescent users of Nicaraguan Sign Language. Results show that those adults who acquired a nascent form of the language during childhood produce few mental-state signs and fail to exhibit false-belief understanding. Furthermore, those whose language developed over the period of the study correspondingly developed in false-belief understanding. Thus, language learning, over and above social experience, drives the development of a mature theory of mind.},

Latent growth curves indicated that learning-related skills had a unique effect on children's reading and math scores between kindergarten and sixth grade and predicted growth in reading and math between kindergarten and second grade. In addition, children with poor learning-related skills performed lower than their higher-rated peers on measures of reading and mathematics between kindergarten and sixth grade, with the gap widening between kindergarten and second grade. Between third and sixth grade, this gap persisted but did not widen.

@article{Yu2013,
	Abstract = {The coordination of visual attention among social partners is central to many components of human behavior and human development. Previous research has focused on one pathway to the coordination of looking behavior by social partners, gaze following. The extant evidence shows that even very young infants follow the direction of another's gaze but they do so only in highly constrained spatial contexts because gaze direction is not a spatially precise cue as to the visual target and not easily used in spatially complex social interactions. Our findings, derived from the moment-to-moment tracking of eye gaze of one-year-olds and their parents as they actively played with toys, provide evidence for an alternative pathway, through the coordination of hands and eyes in goal-directed action. In goal-directed actions, the hands and eyes of the actor are tightly coordinated both temporally and spatially, and thus, in contexts including manual engagement with objects, hand movements and eye movements provide redundant information about where the eyes are looking. Our findings show that one-year-olds rarely look to the parent's face and eyes in these contexts but rather infants and parents coordinate looking behavior without gaze following by attending to objects held by the self or the social partner. This pathway, through eye-hand coupling, leads to coordinated joint switches in visual attention and to an overall high rate of looking at the same object at the same time, and may be the dominant pathway through which physically active toddlers align their looking behavior with a social partner.},

	Abstract = {Kyle's contact info: kylemaho@mit.edu -Across a wide variety of metrics, the real lexicon is clumpier than expected by chance. The effect is stronger among semantically related words but holds even for semantically distant words. -We believe that this reveals a fundamental structure inherent in natural language below the level of the morpheme. The lexicon is phonologically clumpy -Here, we propose several models for generating " null " English lexica that can then be compared against the real English lexicon. In our null lexica, words are sampled i.i.d. with varying levels of constraint. By comparing the simulated lexica to the real lexicon, we can then ask how the presence of other words in the lexical network affects the probability of finding word W in lexicon L.. -If the real lexicon is sparser than expected by chance, that would suggest a drive towards more easily distiguishable forms. If the real lexicon is clumpier than expected by chance, that would suggest a preference for the preferential re-use of sounds in new words. Effect of semantic clustering Compared to the null lexicon, the real lexicon is clumpy by numerous measures of clustering. -There are both more minimal pairs and more 2-edit pairs in the real lexicon than in any simulated lexicon. This holds for specific lengths as well as across the entire lexicon. -Network measures for lexical neighbor networks, (the giant component percentage, transitivity, average clustering) reveal that the real lexicon is more tightly clustered. -Word beginnings are less unique in the real lexicon. I.e, it takes longer to disambiguate a word on average. -The effect holds even for minimal pairs known to be confusable (voiced/unvoiced pairs). We propose and give evidence for several mechanisms by which lexical clumpiness arises: sound symbolism: As shown above, some lexical clumpiness can be attributed to the effect of semantics. Reilly et al. (2012) find that subjects can classify abstract and concrete words based on phonetic properties, and Abelin (1999) finds psychological effects of phonoaesthemes. These types of sound-symbolic effects, which exist in the real lexicon but not in simulated lexica, could give rise to some phonological clustering, but they are not the only source since the effect holds even for semantically distant words. learning bias: Storkel et al. (2006) find that adults more easily learn words in high-density neighborhoods than those in low-density neighborhoods. This preference in learning could contribute to high-neighborhood words being preferentially learned and preserved in the lexicon.},

In Study 1 we find substantial individual differences in children's mastery of multiclause sentences and a significant relation between those differences and the proportion of multiclause sentences in parent speech. We also find individual differences in the number of noun phrases in children's utterances and a significant relation between those differences and the number of noun phrases in parent speech.

This article presents a theoretical framework for evaluating inquiry tasks in terms of how similar they are to authentic science. The framework helps identify the respects in which these reasoning tasks are similar to and different from real scientific research. The framework is based on a recent theory of reasoning, models-of-data theory. We argue that inquiry tasks commonly used in schools evoke reasoning processes that are qualitatively different from the processes employed in real scientific inquiry. Moreover, school reasoning tasks appear to be based on an epistemology that differs from the epistemology of authentic science. Inquiry tasks developed by researchers have increasingly captured features of authentic science, but further improvement is still possible. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our analysis for research, assessment, and instruction.},

Research in cognitive development has long focused on the conceptual changes that accompany word learning, but learning new words also entails perceptual sophistication. Several developmental steps are required as infants learn to segment, identify and represent the phonetic forms of spoken words, and map those word forms to different concepts. We review recent research on how infants' perceptual systems unfold in the service of word learning, from initial sensitivity for speech to the learning of language-specific sound patterns. Building on a recent theoretical framework and emerging new methodologies, we show how speech perception is crucial for word learning, and suggest that it bootstraps the development of a separate but parallel phonological system that links sound to meaning. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {When listeners search for the referent of a speaker's expression, they experience interference from privileged knowledge, knowledge outside of their 'common ground' with the speaker. Evidence is presented that this interference reflects limitations in lexical processing. In three experiments, listeners' eye movements were monitored as they searched for the target of a speaker's referring expression in a display that also contained a phonological competitor (e.g., bucket/buckle). Listeners anticipated that the speaker would refer to something in common ground, but they did not experience less interference from a competitor in privileged ground than from a matched competitor in common ground. In contrast, interference from the competitor was eliminated when it was ruled out by a semantic constraint. These findings support a view of comprehension as relying on multiple systems with distinct access to information and present a challenge for constraint-based views of common ground. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {The effectiveness of the Tools of the Mind (Tools) curriculum in improving the education of 3- and 4-year-old children was evaluated by means of a randomized trial. The Tools curriculum, based on the work of Vygotsky, focuses on the development of self-regulation at the same time as teaching literacy and mathematics skills in a way that is socially mediated by peers and teachers and with a focus on play. The control group experienced an established district-created model described as a "balanced literacy curriculum with themes." Teachers and students were randomly assigned to either treatment or control classrooms. Children (88 Tools and 122 control) were compared on social behavior, language, and literacy growth. The Tools curriculum was found to improve classroom quality and children's executive function as indicated by lower scores on a problem behavior scale. There were indications that Tools also improved children's language development, but these effects were smaller and did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance in multi-level models or after adjustments for multiple comparisons. Our findings indicate that a developmentally appropriate curriculum with a strong emphasis on play can enhance learning and development so as to improve both the social and academic success of young children. Moreover, it is suggested that to the extent child care commonly increases behavior problems this outcome may be reversed through the use of more appropriate curricula that actually enhance self-regulation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new experimental paradigm for studying children's real-time language processing of their parents' unscripted speech. Focusing on children's processing of referential expressions, or the phrases that parents used to label particular objects, we engaged dyads in a game in which parents labeled one of several objects displayed on a screen, and the child was to quickly identify it as their eye gaze was tracked. There were two conditions; one included a competitor object (e.g., the target was a striped umbrella and the display also included an umbrella with polka dots), while the other one did not (e.g., only one umbrella was present). The results revealed evidence of children's incremental processing of their parents' referential expressions. They also showed faster processing of postnominally-modified as compared to prenominally-modified referential expressions. Parents tended to produce postnominally-modified referential expressions in the more difficult experimental condition in which there was a competitor object, suggesting either that these expressions are also easier for them to produce, or that they accommodate their children by producing more easily processed expressions. We discuss the potential of this paradigm for advancing theories of the relationship between child-directed language input and children's language processing.},

	Abstract = {This study explores the cues used in acquisition of two semantically similar structures that are ordered differently in French and English: adjectival phrases and compound nouns. One possible prediction is that children attend primarily to meaning, so they should order both structures similarly. Another is that children attend primarily to structure, so they should learn these structures independently. Two kinds of data were obtained from eight 4-year old bilinguals: (1) spontaneous production and (2) experimental elicitation. The children were nearly perfect in their ordering of adjectival phrases, but less so in compounds. These results conform to neither prediction, leaving open the question of which cues children use in acquisition.},

	Abstract = {Objective: To identify characteristics in nutrition education video vignettes that support learning and motivation to learn about feeding children. Methods: Nine focus group interviews were conducted with child care providers in child care settings from 4 states in the western United States: California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. At each focus group interview, 3-8 participants (n = 37) viewed video vignettes and participated in a facilitated focus group discussion that was audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Results: Primary characteristics of video vignettes child care providers perceived as supporting learning and motivation to learn about feeding young children were identified: (1) use real scenarios; (2) provide short segments; (3) present simple, single messages; (4) convey a skill-in-action; (5) develop the videos so participants can relate to the settings; and (6) support participants' ability to conceptualize the information. Conclusions and Implications: These 6 characteristics can be used by nutrition educators in selecting and developing videos in nutrition education. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.},

	Abstract = {Three experiments explored preschoolers' and adults' understanding of the distinctive semantic functions of adjectives (i.e., to name properties) and count nouns (i.e., to name object kinds). In Experiment 1, we modeled a familiar adjective (e.g., "blue") syntactically as either an adjective (e.g., "This is a blue one") or a count noun (e.g., "This is a blue") and applied it to a target object (e.g., a blue creature). In Experiments 2 and 3, we marked the adjective phonologically as either an adjective (e.g., "This is a blue bird") or a part of a count noun (e.g., "This is a bluebird") and applied it to a target object (e.g., a blue bluebird). In all experiments, participants then had to extend the expression they heard to either an object of a different kind with the same property as the target (e.g., a different creature or bird colored blue) or an object of the same kind with a different property (e.g., the same creature or bird colored red). Four-year-olds and adults, but not 3-year-olds, who heard the adjective version were more likely than those who heard the count noun version to choose the object with the same property. Thus, by the age of four years, children treated a word's lexical category, cued syntactically or phonologically, as a powerful cue to its meaning.},

	Abstract = {Human language is massively ambiguous, yet we are generally able to identify the intended meanings of the sentences we hear and read quickly and accurately. How we manage and resolve ambiguity incrementally during real-time language comprehension given our cognitive resources and constraints is a major question in human cognition. Previous research investigating resource constraints on lexical ambiguity resolution has yielded conflicting results. Here we present results from two experiments in which we recorded eye movements to test for evidence of resource constraints during lexical ambiguity resolution. We embedded moderately biased homographs in sentences with neutral prior context and either long or short regions of text before disambiguation to the dominant or subordinate interpretation. The length of intervening material had no effect on ease of disambiguation. Instead, we found only a main effect of meaning at disambiguation, such that disambiguating to the subordinate meaning of the homograph was more difficult???results consistent with the reordered access model and contemporary probabilistic models, but inconsistent with the capacity-constrained model.},

Studies of the facial display of emotion have documented universally recognized expressions of sadness, anger, fear, and other negative emotions, but have not differentiated among positive emotions. The Duchenne smile, which includes contraction of the orbicularis oculi as well as the zygomaticus major, is generally considered the sole reliable expression of positive affect. The goal of this study was to establish the features of facial and upper-body displays participants associate with the experience of distinct positive emotions.

Cross-cultural studies typically focus on group differences in age-related stages relative to Western norms. We adopted a less traditional approach: We observed 5-month-olds and their mothers from six cultural groups around the world during 1 hr at home while they engaged in natural daily activities. We examined group differences in infants' sitting proficiency, everyday opportunities to practice sitting, the surfaces on which sitting took place, and mothers' proximity to sitting infants. Infants had opportunities to practice sitting in varied contexts--including ground, infant chairs, and raised surfaces. Proficiency varied considerably within and between cultural groups: 64{\%} of the sample sat only with support from mother or furniture and 36{\%} sat independently. Some infants sat unsupported for 20+ min, in some cases so securely that mothers moved beyond arms' reach of their infants even while infants sat on raised surfaces. Our observations of infant sitting across cultures provide new insights into the striking range of ability, varied opportunities for practice, and contextual factors that influence the proficiency of infant motor skills.},

	Abstract = {Recovering discrete words from continuous speech is one of the first challenges facing language learners. Infants and adults can make use of the statistical structure of utterances to learn the forms of words from unsegmented input, suggesting that this ability may be useful for bootstrapping language-specific cues to segmentation. It is unknown, however, whether performance shown in small-scale laboratory demonstrations of "statistical learning" can scale up to allow learning of the lexicons of natural languages, which are orders of magnitude larger. Artificial language experiments with adults can be used to test whether the mechanisms of statistical learning are in principle scalable to larger lexicons. We report data from a large-scale learning experiment that demonstrates that adults can learn words from unsegmented input in much larger languages than previously documented and that they retain the words they learn for years. These results suggest that statistical word segmentation could be scalable to the challenges of lexical acquisition in natural language learning.},

@article{Knudsen2004,
	Abstract = {Experience exerts a profound influence on the brain and, therefore, on behavior. When the effect of experience on the brain is particularly strong during a limited period in development, this period is referred to as a sensitive period. Such periods allow experience to instruct neural circuits to process or represent information in a way that is adaptive for the individual. When experience provides information that is essential for normal development and alters performance permanently, such sensitive periods are referred to as critical periods. Although sensitive periods are reflected in behavior, they are actually a property of neural circuits. Mechanisms of plasticity at the circuit level are discussed that have been shown to operate during sensitive periods. A hypothesis is proposed that experience during a sensitive period modifies the architecture of a circuit in fundamental ways, causing certain patterns of connectivity to become highly stable and, therefore, energetically preferred. Plasticity that occurs beyond the end of a sensitive period, which is substantial in many circuits, alters connectivity patterns within the architectural constraints established during the sensitive period. Preferences in a circuit that result from experience during sensitive periods are illustrated graphically as changes in a ''stability landscape,'' a metaphor that represents the relative contributions of genetic and experiential influences in shaping the information processing capabilities of a neural circuit. By understanding sensitive periods at the circuit level, as well as understanding the relationship between circuit properties and behavior, we gain a deeper insight into the critical role that experience plays in shaping the development of the brain and behavior.},

More specifically, it investigates children's understanding of modifier-head relations of the compounds and their preference for HAS or LOCATED relations (e.g. a donka that HAS a kig or a donka that is LOCATED near a kig) rather than a FOR relation (e.g. a donka that is used FOR kigs). In a forced-choice paradigm, two- and three-year-olds preferred interpretations with HAS/LOCATED relations, while five-year-olds and adults showed no preference for either interpretation. We discuss possible explanations for this preference and its relation to another word learning bias that is based on perceptual features of the referent objects, i.e. the shape bias. We argue that children initially focus on a perceptual stability rather than a pure conceptual stability when interpreting the meaning of nouns.},

	Abstract = {Fetal speech and language abilities were examined in 104 low-risk fetuses at 33-41 weeks gestational age using a familiarization/novelty paradigm. Fetuses were familiarized with a tape recording of either their mother or a female stranger reading the same passage and subsequently presented with a novel speaker or language: Studies (1) {\&} (2) the alternate voice, (3) the father's voice, and (4) a female stranger speaking in native English or a foreign language (Mandarin); heart rate was recorded continuously. Data analyses revealed a novelty response to the mother's voice and a novel foreign language. An offset response was observed following termination of the father's and a female stranger's voice. These findings provide evidence of fetal attention, memory, and learning of voices and language, indicating that newborn speech/language abilities have their origins before birth. They suggest that neural networks sensitive to properties of the mother's voice and native-language speech are being formed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Probabilistic methods are providing new explanatory approaches to fundamental cognitive science questions of how humans structure, process and acquire language. This review examines probabilistic models defined over traditional symbolic structures. Language comprehension and production involve probabilistic inference in such models; and acquisition involves choosing the best model, given innate constraints and linguistic and other input. Probabilistic models can account for the learning and processing of language, while maintaining the sophistication of symbolic models. A recent burgeoning of theoretical developments and online corpus creation has enabled large models to be tested, revealing probabilistic constraints in processing, undermining acquisition arguments based on a perceived poverty of the stimulus, and suggesting fruitful links with probabilistic theories of categorization and ambiguity resolution in perception. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A two-class solution for a latent class model appeared to be defined in part by ability because Class 1 was lower in ability than Class 2 on both the PPVT-III and the Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT). This difference was much larger on the PPVT-III for the low-ability class. No difference was found for the high-ability latent class, suggesting that the difference was a result of something in the PPVT-III that was not present in the EVT. The difference on the PPVT-III for low-ability children appeared to be a result of the structure of the items on the test, which seems to encourage the overriding use of the novel name - nameless category strategy for the selection of an answer - a strategy not available on the EVT.},

Children tended to report that the observer would be able to identify the object from an identifiable or nondescript part. Their judgments were not affected by the age of the observer. Experiment 3 replicated the asymmetry in performance on the general knowledge task and the restricted view task and extended these results by testing 4-year-olds, 6-year-olds, and adults using a within-subjects design.},

The evidence is in conflict: the Deficit Theory is supported by longitudinal studies and studies of children with mathematical learning disabilities, but the Debilitating Anxiety Model is supported by research which manipulates anxiety levels and observes a change in mathematics performance. It is suggested that this mixture of evidence might indicate a bidirectional relationship between MA and mathematics performance (the Reciprocal Theory), in which MA and mathematics performance can influence one another in a vicious cycle.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V. One reason that word learning presents a challenge for children is because pairings between word forms and meanings are arbitrary conventions that children must learn via observation -- e.g., the fact that ``shovel'' labels shovels. The present studies explore cases in which children might bypass observational learning and spontaneously infer new word meanings: By exploiting the fact that many words are flexible and systematically encode multiple, related meanings. For example, words like shovel and hammer are nouns for instruments, and verbs for activities involving those instruments. The present studies explored whether 3- to 5-year-old children possess semantic generalizations about lexical flexibility, and can use these generalizations to infer new word meanings: Upon learning that dax labels an activity involving an instrument, do children spontaneously infer that dax can also label the instrument itself? Across four studies, we show that at least by age four, children spontaneously generalize instrument-activity flexibility to new words. Together, our findings point to a powerful way in which children may build their vocabulary, by leveraging the fact that words are linked to multiple meanings in systematic ways.},

	Annote = {Contextual factors relevant to the calculation of the extension of the positive form include (but are not limited to): the denotation of a modified noun (tall snowman/building/mountain/etc.), an explicit or implicit comparison class (tall for a gymnast), extra-linguistic knowledge (e.g. that a snowman described as `tall' was built by third graders v. fraternity brothers; see Kamp {\&} Partee 1995), and the interests and expectations of the participants in the discourse (Graff 2000).


minimum standard absolute GAs such as spotted, bumpy, wet, bent and impure merely require their arguments to merely possess some non-zero degree of a gradable property. (Spotted is true of an object as long as it has some spots; bent is true of an object if it has some degree of bend.)


However, since our focus here is not on how truth conditions equivalent to (7a--b) are actually derived, but rather on the predictions about the meaning and acceptability of uses of absolute GAs given such truth conditions, we will make the simplifying assumption that the positive forms of relative GAs and maximum/minimum standard GAs are distinct in the way presented here (e.g. because of an ambiguity in pos).6


This suggests that apparent context sensitivity manifested by the two classes of GAs involves different kinds of context/meaning relations: relative GAs are context sensitive relative to an aspect of their meaning (variability in the standard of comparison), while absolute GAs are context sensitive relative to their use (tolerance of imprecision).8

However, the literature is actually not explicit about how these terms can be defined; whether they are distinct; and whether they refer to overt manifestations, learning processes, or learning outcomes. Thus, a framework is provided here that offers a way to differentiate active, constructive, and interactive in terms of obser- vable overt activities and underlying learning processes. The framework generates a testable hypo- thesis for learning: that interactive activities are most likely to be better than constructive activities, which in turn might be better than active activities, which are better than being passive. Studies from the literature are cited to provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. Moreover, postulating under- lying learning processes allows us to interpret evidence in the literature more accurately. Specifying distinct overt activities for active, constructive, and interactive also offers suggestions for how learn- ing activities can be coded and how each kind of activity might be elicited},

	Abstract = {Concreteness-the psycholinguistic property of referring to a perceptible entity-enhances processing speed, comprehension, and memory. These represent selective filters for cognition likely to influence language evolution in competitive language environments. Taking a culturomics approach, we use multiple language corpora representing more than 350 billion words combined with concreteness norms for over 40,000 English words and demonstrate a systematic rise in concrete language in American English over the last 200. years, both within and across word classes (nouns, verbs, and prepositions). Comparisons between new and old concreteness norms indicate this is not explained by semantic bleaching, but we find some evidence that the rise is related to changes in population demographics and may be associated with increasing numbers of second language learners or attention economics in response to crowding in the language market. We also examine the influence of gender and literacy. In sum, we demonstrate evolution in the psycholinguistic structure of American English, with a well-established impact on cognitive processing, which is likely to permeate modern language use.},
	Annote = {evidence demonstrates a systematic rise over two centuries in in one of the most well understood psycholinguistic variables asso- ciated with learnability---concreteness. We further demonstrate that this effect appears to permeate language in a variety of forms (e.g., newspapers, books, and public speeches) and across word classes (e.g., nouns, verbs, and prepositions). We also show that this change is unlikely to be explained by a prominent observation from historical linguistics, semantic bleaching, because a compar- ison between concreteness norms collected 45 years apart shows no evidence for a systematic loss of concreteness among nouns, while during the same time period we observe a systematic rise in concrete nouns (see Fig. 5).

observed changes in concreteness are unlikely to be fully explained by factors such as literacy and gender, but are nonetheless highly correlated with changes in population size and immigration. These latter results are consistent with recent hypotheses that language adapts to the cognitive demands of its users (e.g., Lupyan {\&} Dale, 2010).

quite likely that concreteness is but one change among many in modern American English; changes in rhetorical style or topics of conversation that increase memorability, processing, and retrieval would all be equally consistent with reducing processing difficulty, which is the broader concept we hypothesize to be causative},

	Abstract = {Explaining inconsistency may serve as an important mechanism for driving the process of causal learning. But how might this process generate amended beliefs? One way that explaining inconsistency may promote discovery is by guiding exploratory, hypothesis-testing behavior. In order to investigate this, a study with young children ranging in age from 2 to 6 years (N = 80) examined the relation between explanation and exploratory behavior following consistent versus inconsistent outcomes. Results indicated that for inconsistent outcomes only, the kind of explanation children provided informed the kind of exploratory behavior they engaged in and the extent to which children modified and generated new hypotheses. In sum, the data provide insight into a mechanism by which explaining inconsistent evidence guides causal cognition.},

Comparisons among groups at 4.5, 10.5, and 17 years of age revealed signif- icantly greater I/O in the Romanian Orphan than Canadian Born group at all ages, and greater than the Early Adopted group at ages 4.5 and 10.5. Canadian Born and Early Adopted groups did not differ. Rates of borderline clinical I/O among Romanian Orphans were significantly higher than rates found in the general population; Canadian Born and Early Adopted groups did not differ from the general population. Among Romanian Orphans, I/O was positively related to duration of deprivation; this association did not attenuate over time. Regressions indicated that I/O at age 10.5 was negatively related to warmth and stimulation in the adoptive home and attachment, after accounting for duration of deprivation and age 4.5 I/O. Authoritarian parenting was positively predictive of I/O in children with minimal deprivation and negatively predictive in children with extensive deprivation. Attachment was negatively predictive of I/O in children with less than 19 months' deprivation but unrelated to I/O in those with more than 19 months' deprivation},

	Abstract = {Patterns of correlated activity among brain regions reflect functionally relevant networks that are widely assumed to be stable over time. We hypothesized that if these correlations reflect the prior history of coactivation of brain regions, then a marked shift in cognition could alter the strength of coupling between these regions. We sought to test whether intensive reasoning training in humans would result in tighter coupling among regions in the lateral frontoparietal network, as measured with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Rather than designing an artificial training program, we studied individuals who were preparing for a standardized test that places heavy demands on relational reasoning, the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). LSAT questions require test takers to group or sequence items according to a set of complex rules. We recruited young adults who were enrolled in an LSAT course that offers 70 h of reasoning instruction (n = 25), and age- and IQ-matched controls intending to take the LSAT in the future (n = 24). rs-fMRI data were collected for all subjects during two scanning sessions separated by 90 d. An analysis of pairwise correlations between brain regions implicated in reasoning showed that fronto-parietal connections were strengthened, along with parietal-striatal connections. These findings provide strong evidence for neural plasticity at the level of large-scale networks supporting high-level cognition.},

@article{LaDousa2010,
	Abstract = {This is an expanded version of a paper given at a conference held in Cape Town, South Africa from December 11--13, 2008 entitled ``The Native Speaker and the Mother Tongue.'' In keeping with the conference's themes of exploring and interrogating the notions of ``mother tongue'' and ``native speaker,'' I consider constructions of languages emergent from the school system in Banaras, a city of approximately 2,000,000 in northern India. I do so, in part, because they offer the opportunity to critique sociolinguistic work on northern India for the different ways scholars have used the notion of ``mother tongue'' to ignore the institutional milieu -- schooling -- through which they emerge in everyday life. It is true that ``mother tongue'' is an incredibly salient notion in northern India, and that what language variety can be said to constitute the ``mother tongue'' exhibits great variety in a single locale. But the rich body of scholarly research on language difference in India has largely ignored ethnographic approaches such as the one I offer wherein schools emerge as a key site for people to imagine the significance of language in social life. In order to indicate what an ethnographic approach to the intersection of language difference and school difference might illuminate, I reflect on audio-taped conversations in Banaras, Uttar Pradesh between people from various class and school backgrounds and myself to show that one language variety, Hindi, emerges as the only ``mother tongue'' authorized for school use. More importantly, I show that such ideological work underpins a specific kind of narrative about what it means to be able to succeed in school but remain faithful to one's ``mother tongue.'' In doing so, I hope to contribute to one of the conference's goals: demonstrating the sociopolitical underpinnings of the notion of ``mother tongue.''},

@article{Lockridge2002,
	Abstract = {A current debate in psycholinguistics concerns how speakers take addressees' knowledge or needs into account during the packaging of utterances. In retelling stories, speakers are more likely to mention atypical instruments than easily inferrable, typical instruments; in a seminal study, Brown and Dell (1987) suggested that this is not an adjustment to addressees but is simply easiest for speakers. They concluded that manipulating addressees' knowledge did not affect speakers' mention of instruments. However, their addressees were confederates who heard the same stories repeatedly. We had speakers retell stories to naive addressees who either saw or did not see a picture illustrating the main action and instrument. When addressees lacked pictures, speakers were more likely to mention atypical instruments, to mention them early (within the same clause as the action verb), and to mark atypical instruments as indefinite. This suggests that with visual copresence, speakers can take addressees' knowledge into account in early syntactic choices.},

We aim at emphasizing the importance of language in guiding categorization relatively to other cues such as age, race and gender. We discuss the importance of language as part of a communication system that orients infants and older children's attention toward relevant information in their environment and toward affiliated social partners who are potential sources of knowledge. We argue that other cues (visually perceptible features) are less reliable in informing individuals whether others share a common knowledge and whether they can be source of information.},

@article{Trueswell1996,
	Abstract = {The role of lexical frequency in syntactic ambiguity resolution was explored in two self-paced reading studies of ambiguous reduced relative clauses. Recent constraint-based models of syntactic ambiguity resolution have proposed that for a reduced relative clause (e.g., ''The room searched by the police was...''), both the participle and past tense forms of the ambiguous verb (''searched'') are made available in parallel and that local syntactic and semantic information are used to resolve the ambiguity within a parallel constraint-satisfaction process (MacDonald, Pearlmutter, {\&} Seidenberg, 1994a; Trueswell, Tanenhaus, {\&} Garnsey, 1994). A crucial prediction of these models is that the frequency with which the verb is used as a participle form in the language should affect a reader's ability to consider the relative clause alternative. This prediction was confirmed in two self-paced reading experiments that directly manipulated participle frequency while controlling for the degree of contextual constraint. Implications for constraint-based lexicalist accounts of sentence comprehension are discussed. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive science aims to reverse-engineer the mind, and many of the engineering challenges the mind faces involve induction. The probabilistic approach to modeling cognition begins by identifying ideal solutions to these inductive problems. Mental processes are then modeled using algorithms for approximating these solutions, and neural processes are viewed as mechanisms for implementing these algorithms, with the result being a top-down analysis of cognition starting with the function of cognitive processes. Typical connectionist models, by contrast, follow a bottom-up approach, beginning with a characterization of neural mechanisms and exploring what macro-level functional phenomena might emerge. We argue that the top-down approach yields greater flexibility for exploring the representations and inductive biases that underlie human cognition.},

A large sample of university students (n = 279) was administered the SIMA and the 25-item Shortened Math Anxiety Rating Scale (sMARS) to evaluate the relation between the scores of the two measures. The university students were also administered other tests to provide validity evidence for the SIMA scores. The temporal stability of the SIMA scores was also evaluated over a 7-week testretest interval. The findings of the study demonstrated that the SIMA scores showed evidence of validity and strong test-retest reliability.

@article{Mahowald2016,
	Abstract = {We performed an exhaustive meta-analysis of 73 peer-reviewed journal articles on syntactic priming from the seminal Bock (1986) paper through 2013. Extracting the effect size for each experiment and condition, where the effect size is the log odds ratio of the frequency of the primed structure X to the frequency of the unprimed structure Y, we found a robust effect of syntactic priming with an average weighted odds ratio of 1.67 when there is no lexical overlap and 3.26 when there is. That is, a construction X which occurs 50{\%} of the time in the absence of priming would occur 63{\%} if primed without lexical repetition and 77{\%} of the time if primed with lexical repetition. The syntactic priming effect is robust across several different construction types and languages, and we found strong effects of lexical overlap on the size of the priming effect as well as interactions between lexical repetition and temporal lag and between lexical repetition and whether the priming occurred within or across languages. We also analyzed the distribution of p-values across experiments in order to estimate the average statistical power of experiments in our sample and to assess publication bias. Analyzing a subset of experiments in which the primary result of interest is whether a particular structure showed a priming effect, we did not find evidence of major p-hacking and the studies appear to have acceptable statistical power: 82{\%}. However, analyzing a subset of experiments that focus not just on whether syntactic priming exists but on how syntactic priming is moderated by other variables (such as repetition of words in prime and target, the location of the testing room, and the memory of the speaker), we found that such studies are, on average, underpowered with estimated average power of 53{\%}. Using a subset of 45 papers from our sample for which we received raw data, we estimated subject and item variation and give recommendations for appropriate sample size for future syntactic priming studies.},

	Abstract = {The beliefs people hold about the social and physical world are central to self-definition and social interaction. The current research analyzes reasoning about three kinds of beliefs: those that concern matters of fact (e.g., dinosaurs are extinct), preference (e.g., green is the prettiest color), and ideology (e.g., there is only one God). The domain of ideology is of unique interest because it is hypothesized to contain elements of both facts and preferences. If adults' distinct reasoning about ideological beliefs is the result of prolonged experience with the physical and social world, children and adults should reveal distinct patterns of differentiating kinds of beliefs, and this difference should be particularly pronounced with respect to ideological beliefs. On the other hand, if adults' reasoning about beliefs is a basic component of social cognition, children and adults should demonstrate similar belief representations and patterns of belief differentiation. Two experiments demonstrate that 5-10 year old children and adults similarly judged religious beliefs to be intermediate between factual beliefs (where two disagreeing people cannot both be right) and preferences (where they can). From the age of 5 years and continuing into adulthood, individuals distinguished ideological beliefs from other types of mental states and demonstrated limited tolerance for belief-based disagreements. ?? 2012.},

@phdthesis{Syrett2007,
	Abstract = {This work investigates children's early semantic representations of gradable adjectives (GAs) and proposes that infants perform a probabilistic analysis of the input to learn about abstract differences within this category. I first demonstrate that children as young as age three distinguish between relative (e.g., big, long), maximum standard absolute (e.g., full, straight), and minimum standard absolute (e.g., spotted, bumpy) GAs in the way that the standard of comparison is set and how it interacts with the discourse context. I then ask if adverbs enable infants to learn these differences. In a corpus analysis, I demonstrate that statistically significant patterns of adverbial modification are available to the language learner: restricted adverbs (e.g., completely) are more likely than non-restricted adverbs (e.g., very) to select for maximal GAs with bounded scales. Non-maximal GAs, which are more likely to be modified by adverbs in general, are more likely to be modified by a narrower range, predominantly composed of intensifiers (e.g., very). I then ask if language learners recruit this information when learning new adjectives. In a word learning task employing the preferential looking paradigm, I demonstrate that 30-month-olds use adverbial modifiers they are not necessarily producing to assign an interpretation to novel adjectives. Adjectives modified by completely are assigned an interpretation corresponding to an absolute property, while adjectives modified by very correspond to a relative property. Infants presented with an adjective modified by no adverb, a 4 novel adverb (penticly), or a low-frequency intensifier (extremely) pattern at chance. I argue that a form-meaning correspondence similar to the one discussed in verb learning is active in adjective learning. Infants are guided by their conceptual representations when attending to the distributional patterns of adverb-adjective bigrams in the exposure language, and expect that these surface-level cues will partition the class of GAs according to differences in scalar structure. I finish by connecting the structure of scales and paths in linguistic representations, and suggest that given that infants attend to the structure of paths when parsing events, it is optimistic to expect that they might also attend to the structure of scales when attending to properties.},

	Abstract = {Literature on the structure of two-person conversations has consistently found that partners become more similar in mean duration of pauses and switching pauses over the course ot interaction. Evidence on influence in vocalization duration is primarily negative. No direct evidence otinterspeaker influence on a moment-to-moment basis is at ailable. In this study 12 dyadic conversations are analyzed for interspeaker influence, with the use ot'time series regression procedures. Two versions ofthe data are presented: a probability suniniary including the probability of breaking mutual silences, continuing simultaneous talk, and continuing talking alone and a turn summary including vocalira- tion, pause, and switching pause duration. Results show that (I ) moment-to-moment intluences are present in both versions ofthe data, (2) these intluences differ from dyad to dyad, (3) the intluences are both positive (matching) and negative (compensating), and (4) the magnitude of interspeaker influence on a temporal basis is small but detectable. In addition, there are overall tendencies to match in switching pause, probability of continued simultaneous speech, and probability of breaking mutual dences. Dyads show both compensation and matching on vocalization duration and pause-related variables. Implications of these data for past and future explanation of social interaction are explored.},

	Abstract = {This article proposes that plural marking on nouns in Persian is licensed only if those nouns are contained within D/QPs. This proposal accounts for why plural-marked nouns are construed as definite unless an overt marker of indefiniteness appears, and why plural marking does not cooccur with numerals unless the noun phrase is definite. It is also shown that the indefinite marker in Persian is quantitative rather than cardinal and is thus associated with higher functional structure within the noun phrase than in English. In English, on the other hand, number marking, the indefinite article, and the grammatical distinction between count and mass nouns, are all realized at the level of NumP. Differences in the interpretation of bare noun phrases in English and Persian are therefore explained by the claim that argument noun phrases must minimally be NumPs in English while Persian lacks this projection altogether.},

However, previous research has not tested the wide range of acoustic parameters present in many different types of world music. The purpose of the present study is to determine the spontaneous preference of common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) for 3 acoustically contrasting types of world music: West African akan, North Indian raga, and Japanese taiko. Sixteen chimpanzees housed in 2 groups were exposed to 40 min of music from a speaker placed 1.5moutside the fence of their outdoor enclosure; the proximity of each subject to the acoustic stimulus was recorded every 2 min. When compared with controls, subjects spent significantly more time in areas where the acoustic stimulus was loudest in African and Indian music conditions. This preference for African and Indian music could indicate homologies in acoustic preferences between nonhuman and human primates. Keywords:},

Here we show that deaf and hearing individuals exposed to language in infancy perform comparably well in learning a new language later in life, whereas deaf individuals with little language experience in early life perform poorly, regardless of whether the early language was signed or spoken and whether the later language was spoken or signed. These findings show that language-learning ability is determined by the onset of language experience during early brain development, independent of the specific form of the experience.},

An empirical investigation of the relation of social-pragmatic and data-providing features of input to the productive vocabulary of sixty-three 2-year-old children revealed benefits of data provided in mother-child conversation, but no effects of social aspects of those conversations. The findings further revealed that the properties of data that benefit lexical development in 2-year-olds are quantity, lexical richness, and syntactic complexity. The nature of the computational mechanisms implied by these findings is discussed. An integrated account of the roles of social and computational processes to lexical development is proposed.},

Recent work has suggested that predictability effects result from hardwired properties of the language production system, rather than ac-tive modulation by the talker to accommodate the listener. However, these studies investigated only minor manipulations of listener characteristics. Here, we examine predictability ef-fects with two very different listener populations: adults and preverbal infants. Using mixed effects regressions on spon-taneous speech corpora, we compare the effect of word fre-quency, probability in context, and previous mention on word duration in adult-directed and infant-directed speech. We find that the effects of preceding context and word frequency differ according to listener. Contrary to previous work, these results suggest that talkers do modulate the phonetic effects of pre-dictability based on listener characteristics. To our knowledge, this study is also the first published analysis of predictability effects in infant-directed speech.},

	Abstract = {An academic scientist's professional success depends on publishing. Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive---getting it right---competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive---getting it published. This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases.},

	Abstract = {Young infants' learning of words for abstract concepts like 'all gone' and 'eat,' in contrast to their learning of more concrete words like 'apple' and 'shoe,' may follow a relatively protracted developmental course. We examined whether infants know such abstract words. Parents named one of two events shown in side-by-side videos while their 6-16-month-old infants (n= 98) watched. On average, infants successfully looked at the named video by 10. months, but not earlier, and infants' looking at the named referent increased robustly at around 14. months. Six-month-olds already understand concrete words in this task (Bergelson {\&} Swingley, 2012). A video-corpus analysis of unscripted mother-infant interaction showed that mothers used the tested abstract words less often in the presence of their referent events than they used concrete words in the presence of their referent objects. We suggest that referential uncertainty in abstract words' teaching conditions may explain the later acquisition of abstract than concrete words, and we discuss the possible role of changes in social-cognitive abilities over the 6-14. month period. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

An initial experiment, in which participants played a computer game that required them to learn which stimuli, when sampled, produced favorable or unfavorable outcomes, demonstrated learning, attitude formation, and generalization to novel objects.

Findings from 4 experiments led to an explanation of the learning asymmetry in terms of information gain being contingent on approach behavior and related the generalization asymmetry to a negativity bias that weighs resemblance to a known negative more heavily than resemblance to a positive.},

	Abstract = {From the very first studies researchers on the effect of age-of-acquisition (AoA) on word processing have validated their AoA ratings by correlating them with other, more objective indices of the age at which children know words. Still, the ratings have been questioned and alternative measures have been proposed. Two of these are differences in word frequency between language directed at young children and language directed at older children (frequency trajectory) and AoA ratings corrected for word frequency. Surprisingly, the criterion validity of these alternative measures has never been established, partly because one of the validation criteria (the age at which children are able to name pictures) has been questioned. In the present study, four databases are used that aimed to establish the order of English word acquisition, going from the very first words learned to words taught in secondary education. The criteria for word knowledge included word production, multiple choice questions about the meaning of the words, and teacher judgments about when words should be taught in the school curriculum. For all databases, the frequency trajectory correlated substantially less with the criterion than AoA ratings. For all but one, the same was true for AoA ratings 'corrected' for other variables. On the basis of these findings, researchers should be cautious interpreting null effects with the 'improved' variables as evidence against a genuine AoA effect.},

	Abstract = {Pragmatics has historically played a relatively pe-ripheral role in language evolution research. This is a pro-found mistake. Here I describe how a pragmatic perspective can inform language evolution in the most fundamental way: by making clear what the natural objects of study are, and hence what the aims of the field should be. For most of its history as an academic discipline, the principal intellectual concern of linguistics has been with the structure of the different levels of linguistic form. Figure 1 illustrates the different levels as classically understood (the image is from Wikimedia, where it is entitled BMajor levels of linguistic structure{\^{}}). For all but the outermost level, the items in ques-tion---sounds, phonemes, words, phrases, and literal mean-ing---are either discrete in character or can be treated as such. This discreteness makes quantitative and formal analysis more straightforward than it otherwise would be, and as such is a boon to scientific investigation. The sixth, outermost layer of Fig. 1---pragmatics---is where the linguistic rubber hits the communicative road, and this interface with the outside world brings with it a raft of issues that make any assumption of discreteness problematic, and as such complicate linguistic analysis. There is, for example, no simple and/or natural way to treat speaker meaning as a discrete object of enquiry. Depending on one's specific questions, it can be productive to abstract away from the complications that pragmatics brings with it. Indeed, this is sometimes the most scientifically appropriate thing to do. (All scientific investigation necessar-ily abstracts away from issues at other levels of analysis.) Many linguistic topics can be profitably pursued without any consideration of pragmatics. One consequence of this is that, despite common acknowledgment that it is an important di-mension of language and language use, pragmatics is kept at the margins of linguistics as a discipline. In short, the fact that it is concerned with the boundary between language and the outside world is, ironically, a major reason why pragmatics is kept on the periphery of the discipline itself. Even if unintended, this marginalization of pragmatics af-fects the direction of research in linguistics, and language evolution is a case in point. If you doubt this, turn to the index of the Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution, a book billed, accurately, as Ba wide-ranging summation of work in all the disciplines involved [in language evolution]{\^{}} (Tallerman {\&} Gibson, 2012). There you will find 213 pages listed under Bsyntax{\^{}} and related terms; 100 pages listed under Bphonetics,{\^{}} Bphonology,{\^{}} and related terms; but just eight},

Bilinguals had more TOTs than did monolinguals unless the target pictures had translatable cognate names, and bilinguals had fewer TOTs for noncognates they were later able to translate. TOT rates for the same targets in monolinguals indicated that these effects could not be attributed to target difficulty. Two popular TOT accounts must be modified to explain cognate and translatability facilitation effects, and cross-language interference cannot explain bilinguals' increased TOTs rates. Instead the authors propose that, relative to monolinguals, bilinguals are less able to activate representations specific to each language.},

Results revealed that children taught shapes in the guided play condition showed improved shape knowledge compared to the other groups, an effect that was still evident after 1 week.

	Abstract = {The distribution of word orders across languages is highly nonuniform, with subject-verb-object (SVO) and subject-object-verb (SOV) orders being prevalent. Recent work suggests that the SOV order may be the default in human language. Why, then, is SVO order so common? We hypothesize that SOV/SVO variation can be explained by language users' sensitivity to the possibility of noise corrupting the linguistic signal. In particular, the noisy-channel hypothesis predicts a shift from the default SOV order to SVO order for semantically reversible events, for which potential ambiguity arises in SOV order because two plausible agents appear on the same side of the verb. We found support for this prediction in three languages (English, Japanese, and Korean) by using a gesture-production task, which reflects word-order preferences largely independent of native language. Other patterns of crosslinguistic variation (e.g., the prevalence of case marking in SOV languages and its relative absence in SVO languages) also straightforwardly follow from the noisy-channel hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {The frequency distribution of words has been a key object of study in statistical linguistics for the past 70 years. This distribution approximately follows a simple mathematical form known as Zipf 's law. This paper first shows that human language has highly complex, reliable structure in the frequency distribution over and above this classic law, though prior data visualization methods obscured this fact. A number of empirical phenomena related to word frequencies are then reviewed. These facts are chosen to be informative about the mechanisms giving rise to Zipf's law, and are then used to evaluate many of the theoretical explanations of Zipf's law in language. No prior account straightforwardly explains all the basic facts, nor is supported with independent evaluation of its underlying assumptions. To make progress at understanding why language obeys Zipf's law, studies must seek evidence beyond the law itself, testing assumptions and evaluating novel predictions with new, independent data.},

essentially all of the work in language research has focused on solely deriving the law itself in principle; very little work has attempted to assess the underlying assumptions of the hypothesized explanation, a problem for much work on power laws in science (Stumpf {\&} Porter, 2012)2. It should be clear why this is problematic: the law itself can be derived from many starting points. Therefore, the ability of a theory to derive the law provides very weak evidence for that account's cognitive validity. Other evidence is needed

	Abstract = {Speaker eye gaze and gesture are known to help child and adult listeners establish communicative alignment and learn object labels. Here we consider how learners use these cues, along with linguistic information, to acquire abstract relational verbs. Test items were persepctive verb pairs (e.g., chase/flee, win/lose), which pose a special problem for observational accounts of word learning because their situational contexts overlap very closely; the learner must infer the speaker's chosen perspective on the event. Two cues to the speaker's perspective on a depicted event were compared and combined: (a) the speaker's eye gaze to an event participant (e.g., looking at the Chaser vs. looking at the Fllee-er) and (b) the speaker's linguistic choice of which event participant occupies Subject position in his utterance. Participants (3-, 4- and 5-year-olds) were eye-tracked as they watched a series of videos of a man describing drawings of perspective events (e.g., a rabbit chasing an elephant). The speaker looked at one of hte two characters and then uttered either an utterance that was referentially uninformative (He's mooping him) or inforamtive (The rabbit's mooping the elephant/The elephant's mooping the rabbit) because of the syntactic bootstrapping of the nouns. Eye-tracking results showed that all participants regardless of age followed the speaker's gaze in both uninformative and informative contexts. However, verb-mearning choices were responsive to speaker's gaze direction only in the lingusitically uninformative condition. In the presence of a lingusitically informative context, effects of speaker gaze on meaning were minimal for the youngest children to nonexistent for the older populations. Thus children, like adults, can use multiple cues to inform verb-meaning choice but rapidly learn that the syntactic positioning of referring expressions is an especially informative source of evidence for these decisions.},

	Abstract = {Bilingualism research has established language non-selective lexical access in comprehension. However, the evidence for such an effect in production remains sparse and its neural time-course has not yet been investigated. We demonstrate that German-English bilinguals performing a simple picture-naming task exclusively in English spontaneously access the phonological form of -unproduced- German words. Participants were asked to produce English adjective-noun sequences describing the colour and identity of familiar objects presented as line drawings. We associated adjective and picture names such that their onsets phonologically overlapped in English (e.g., green goat), in German through translation (e.g., blue flower - 'blaue Blume'), or in neither language. As expected, phonological priming in English modulated event-related brain potentials over the frontocentral scalp region from around 440. ms after picture onset. Phonological priming in German was detectable even earlier, from 300. ms, even though German was never produced and in the absence of an interaction between language and phonological repetition priming at any point in time. Overall, these results establish the existence of non-selective access to phonological representations of the two languages in the domain of speech production. ?? 2014.},
	Annote = {"Are bilingual speakers' lexicons always both active during speech production, even when speaking the non-dominant/non-native language?"
The authors crossed two within-subjects variables in their stimuli: phonological overlap and language of the overlap. Subjects were asked to name pictures with the appropriate adjective-noun pair in their L2, English. The adjective and noun either shared an onset in German (their L1), shared an onset in English, or did not in either. The authors collected ERP and reaction time data. They expected that phoneme repetition in L2 would decrease ERP amplitudes around 350 ms after stimulus presentation, and were interested in the time course of the effect of phoneme repetition on ERP amplitudes (if it existed) when the repetition was in L1 versus L2. The authors seemed also to expect that reaction times in the phoneme repetition conditions of each language might be faster than those of controls.
The authors found no behavioral evidence for a phonological priming effect when the phonological overlap was in speakers' L1 and production was in their L2: reaction times for production of adjective-noun pairs with and without overlapping onsets was different only when that overlap was in L2 (the language of production). They did, however, find somewhat weak evidence for non-language-specific phoneme repetition priming for both languages in the ERP data: phoneme repetition was associated with decreased ERP amplitudes for both languages, but a significant difference between repetition and control was seen 150 ms earlier for L1 than for L2. The authors take their findings to imply that phonological segments, in addition to lexical alternatives, for both languages are activated in the L2 language production of a bilingual speaker. They may also say something about the relative time course of L1 versus L2 activation, with L1 apparently more rapid or immediate.},

@article{Witt2009,
	Abstract = {While there is little doubt that there is a connection between mathematics anxiety and poor mathematical performance, the direction and nature of this connection is less clear. Some researchers (e.g., Ma {\&} Xu, 2004) have contended that poor mathematical performance directly causes mathematics anxiety. Others see a more complex relationship in which mathematics anxiety may, in part at least, cause poor mathematical performance. One possible explanation for the latter view is that mathematics anxiety leads directly to a disruption of cognitive processes such as working memory, which leads directly to poorer mathematical performance (Hopko, Ashcraft, Gute, Ruggiero, {\&} Lewis, 1998). The working memory component most consistently associated with mathematics anxiety is the central executive (Ashcraft {\&} Krause, 2007), although there is evidence (Miller {\&} Bichsel, 2004) that visual-spatial working memory is impaired by mathematics anxiety. This study sought to explore the suggestion (Ashcraft {\&} Kirk, 2001) that the mere presence of digits might trigger an anxious reaction among children reporting high levels of mathematics anxiety, leading to a decrement in working memory performance. Children of 9 and 10 years of age reported levels of mathematics anxiety and undertook two working memory tasks, one measuring central executive functioning and the other measuring visual-spatial working memory. Each working memory task was completed twice, once using letters as the to-be-remembered stimuli and again using digits. The differences in performance between the two versions of the tasks were compared with the reported levels of mathematics anxiety. The findings suggest that the presence of digits as the stimuli caused a decrement in working memory performance commensurate with the reported levels of mathematical anxiety.},

	Abstract = {In conversation, speakers tend to ``accommodate'' or ``align'' to their partners, changing the style and substance of their communications to be more similar to their partners' utterances. We focus here on ``linguistic alignment,'' changes in word choice based on others' choices. Although linguistic alignment is observed across many different contexts and its degree correlates with important social factors such as power and likability, its sources are still uncertain. We build on a recent probabilistic model of alignment, using it to separate out alignment attributable to words versus word categories. We model alignment in two contexts: telephone conversations and microblog replies. Our results show evidence of alignment, but it is primarily lexical rather than categorical. Furthermore, we find that discourse acts modulate alignment substantially. This evidence supports the view that alignment is shaped by strategic communicative processes related to the ongoing discourse.},

	Abstract = {Many preschool children fail to achieve the National Association for Sport and Physical Education physical activity recommendations placing themselves at increased risk of overweight and its associated health consequences. The early learning and care system is well positioned to intervene. Yet few child obesity prevention efforts have focused on systematically integrating physical activity into early learning and care. A pre/post design examined the association between changes in physical activity practices and providers' beliefs regarding their role in supporting children's physical activity. Survey and observational data from 43 sites participating in the Encouraging Healthy Activity and Nutrition in Child Care Environments pilot project were analyzed. Statistically significant increases were found in providers' perceptions of role salience and the need for adult leadership to increase children's physical activity. Significant improvements in indoor child care physical activity practices, physical education, and family communication occurred. A binary logistic regression indicated that changes in adult leadership and role salience were significantly associated with changes in physical activity practices. Understanding and modifying child care providers' beliefs regarding their role in children's physical activity is a critical component for the successful implementation of obesity prevention initiatives designed to increase child activity levels.

Learning these concepts in isolation can be difficult, but we present a model that discovers entire systems of related concepts. These systems can be viewed as simple theories that specify the concepts that exist in a domain, and the laws or principles that relate these concepts. We apply our model to several real-world problems, including learning the structure of kinship systems and learning ontologies. We also compare its predictions to data collected in two behavioral experiments. Experiment 1 shows that our model helps to explain how simple theories are acquired and used for inductive inference. Experiment 2 suggests that our model provides a better account of theory discovery than a more traditional alternative that focuses on features rather than relations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Child-directed cues support imitation of novel actions at 18 months, but not at two years of age. The current studies explore the mechanisms that underlie the propensity that children have to copy others at 18 months, and how the value of child-directed communication changes over development. We ask if attentional allocation accounts for children's failure to imitate observed actions at 18 months, and their success at two years of age, and we explore the informational value child-directed contexts may provide across ontogeny. Eighteen-month-old (Study 1) and two-year-old (Study 2) children viewed causally non-obvious actions performed by child-directed (Study 1 {\&} 2), observed (Study 1 {\&} 2), or non-interactive (Study 2) actors, and their visual attention and imitative behaviors were assessed. Results demonstrated that child-directed contexts supported imitative learning for 18-month-old children, independent of their effects on proximal attention. However, by two years of age, neither directness nor communication between social partners was a necessary condition for supporting social imitation. These findings suggest that developmental changes in children's propensity to extract information from observation cannot be accounted for by changes in children's interpretation of what counts as child-directed information, and are likely not due to changes in how children allocate attention to observed events.},

In this review, we explore a central prediction of statistical learning accounts of language acquisition - that sensitivity to statistical structure should be linked to real language processes - via an examination of: (1) recent studies that have increased the ecological validity of the stimuli; (2) studies that suggest statistical segmentation produces representations that share properties with real words; (3) correlations between individual variability in statistical learning ability and individual variability in language outcomes; and (4) atypicalities in statistical learning in clinical populations characterized by language delays or deficits.},

	Abstract = {German and French differ in a number of aspects. Regarding the prosody-pragmatics interface, German is said to have a direct focus-to-accent mapping, which is largely absent in French -- owing to strong structural constraints. We used a semi-spontaneous dialogue setting to investigate the intonational marking of Verum Focus, a focus on the polarity of an utterance in the two languages (e.g. the child IS tearing the banknote as an opposite claim to the child is not tearing the banknote). When Verum Focus applies to auxiliaries, pragmatic aspects (i.e. highlighting the contrast) directly compete with structural constraints (e.g. avoiding an accent on phonologically weak elements such as monosyllabic function words). Intonational analyses showed that auxiliaries were predominantly accented in German, as expected. Interestingly, we found a high number of (as yet undocumented) focal accents on phrase-initial auxiliaries in French Verum Focus contexts. When French accent patterns were equally distributed across information structural contexts, relative prominence (in terms of peak height) between initial and final accents was shifted towards initial accents in Verum Focus compared to non-Verum Focus contexts. Our data hence suggest that French also may mark Verum Focus by focal accents but that this tendency is partly overridden by strong structural constraints.},

Here we examine how fairness behaviour develops in children from seven diverse societies, testing children from 4 to 15 years of age (n = 866 pairs) in a standardized resource decision task6,7. We measured two key aspects of fairness decisions: disadvantageous inequity aversion (peer receives more than self) and advantageous inequity aversion (self receives more than a peer). We show that disadvantageous inequity aversion emerged across all populations by middle childhood. By contrast, advantageous inequity aversion was more variable, emerging in three populations and only later in development.

One model assumes that common ground is involved in initial utterance planning, while the other model assumes that it only plays a role in monitoring. To compare these models, we focus on common ground as evidenced in physical co-presence. We had speakers describe objects for listeners in a modified version of the referential communication task. While descriptions under no time constraints appeared to incorporate common ground with the listener, common ground was not used when the speakers were under time pressure. These results suggest that speakers do not engage in audience design in the initial planning of utterances; instead, they monitor those plans for violations of common ground.},

Instead, there is considerable evidence that the same individuals use both natural and supernatural explanations to interpret the very same events and that there are multiple ways in which both kinds of explanations coexist in individual minds. Converging developmental research from diverse cultural contexts in 3 areas of biological thought (i.e., the origin of species, illness, and death) is reviewed to support this claim. Contrary to traditional accounts of cognitive development, new evidence indicates that supernatural explanations often increase rather than decrease with age and supports the proposal that reasoning about supernatural phenomena is an integral and enduring aspect of human cognition.},

Attending to events that are not addressed to oneself (third-party attention) appears to be central to learning in communities with Indigenous Mesoamerican history. Learning from third-party attention may be an important but overlooked developmental context. Although most research on teaching and learning has focused on situations in which children are addressed directly, some research indicates that events not directed at children provide them with important information in many communities. Middle-class U.S. toddlers assess a stranger's character or the emotional valence of a new situation by observing other people's reactions to the stranger or situation (Feiring, Lewis, {\&} Starr, 1983; Repacholi {\&} Meltzoff, 2007). Children across many communities also learn vocabulary and appropriate language use by overhearing conversation (Akhtar, 2005; Barton {\&} Tomasello, 1991; Ochs, 1988; Oshima-Takane, Goodz, {\&} Deverensky, 1996; Schieffelin, 1991; Ward, 1971).},

Articulation rate in spontaneous speech was modeled using fixed-mixed effects analyses. The models explored the effects of the between-speaker factors dialect, age and gender and included each phrase and its length as a source of both between- and within-speaker variation. The major findings are: (1) Wisconsin speakers speak significantly faster and produce shorter phrases than North Carolina speakers; (2) speech tempo changes across the lifespan, being fastest for individuals in their 40s; (3) men speak faster than women and this effect is not related to the length of phrases they produce. Articulation rate in reading was slower than in speaking and the effects of gender and age also differed in reading and spontaneous speech. The effects of dialect in reading remained the same, showing again that Wisconsin speakers had faster articulation rates than did North Carolina speakers.},

	Abstract = {When addressing infants, many adults adopt a particular type of speech, known as in- fant-directed speech (IDS). IDS is characterized by exaggerated intonation, as well as reduced speech rate, shorter utterance duration, and grammatical simplification. It is commonly asserted that IDS serves in part to facilitate language learning. Al- though intuitively appealing, direct empirical tests of this claim are surprisingly scarce. Additionally, studies that have examined associations between IDS and lan- guage learning have measured learning within a single laboratory session rather than the type of long-term storage of information necessary for word learning. In this study, 7- and 8-month-old infants' long-term memory for words was assessed when words were spoken in IDS and adult-directed speech (ADS). Word recognition over the long term was successful for words introduced in IDS, but not for those intro- duced in ADS, regardless of the register in which recognition stimuli were produced. Findings are discussed in the context of the influence of particular input styles on emergent word knowledge in prelexical infants.},

	Abstract = {English mass noun phrases {\&} count noun phrases differ only minimally grammatically. The basis for the difference is ascribed to a difference in the features +/-CT. These features serve the morphosyntactic function of determining the available options for the assigment of grammatical number, itself determined by the features +/-PL: +CT places no restriction on the available options, while -CT, in the unmarked case, restricts the available options to -PL. They also serve the semantic function of determining the sort of denotation associated with demonstrative {\&} quantified noun phrases. The feature -CT requires that the associated denotation be the set whose sole member is the greatest aggregate of which the noun phrase or noun is true; the feature +CT requires that the associated denotation be the set whose members are all {\&} only those minimal aggregates of which the noun phrase or noun is true. At the same time, neither mass NPs nor count NPs that are arguments of a predicate have their predicate evaluated with respect to their denotations. Rather, the predicate is evaluated with respect to an aggregation, a set of aggregates constructed from the denotation of the noun phrase that is an argument of the predicate. 3 Tables, 4 Figures, 74 References.

Children's explanations could be triggered by either consistent events (suggesting that explanations serve a confirmatory function) or inconsistent events (suggesting that they promote discovery of new information). In 2 studies with preschool children (N = 80), events that were consistent with children's prior knowledge were simultaneously contrasted with events that were inconsistent with prior knowledge, and children were invited to explain either outcome (or both). Results demonstrate that inconsistent outcomes are an especially powerful trigger for children's explanations and that the explanations children provide for inconsistent outcomes refer to internal causal properties, overriding perceptual appearances. In sum, the data provide empirical evidence that inconsistent events motivate children to construct explanations, thereby suggesting that children's explanations function in the service of discovery.},

	Abstract = {This study examined the role of self-regulation in emerging academic ability in one hundred and forty-one 3- to 5-year-old children from low-income homes. Measures of effortful control, false belief understanding, and the inhibitory control and attention-shifting aspects of executive function in preschool were related to measures of math and literacy ability in kindergarten. Results indicated that the various aspects of child self-regulation accounted for unique variance in the academic outcomes independent of general intelligence and that the inhibitory control aspect of executive function was a prominent correlate of both early math and reading ability. Findings suggest that curricula designed to improve self-regulation skills as well as enhance early academic abilities may be most effective in helping children succeed in school.},

	Abstract = {While some word meanings, like ``spotted,'' depend on intersubjectively accessible properties of the world, others like ``pretty'' invoke speakers' subjective beliefs. We explored children and adults' sensitivity to the subjectivity of a range of adjectives, including words like ``spotted'' and ``pretty,'' but also words like ``tall,'' which are evaluated relative to a standard. Participants saw two speakers who had independently experienced sets of exemplars of a novel object kind disagree about whether a critical exemplar was, e.g., ``tall,'' ``pretty,'' and ``spotted.'' In Experiments 1 and 3, speakers had seen distinct sets of exemplars, while in Experiments 2 and 4, the sets were identical. Adults always judged disagreements over words like ``pretty'' as faultless---indicating that both speakers ``could be right''---and permitted less faultless disagreement for ones like ``tall'' when the speakers had experienced identical sets of exemplars. Strikingly, children did not respond in an adult-like manner until age 8 or 9, but their explanations for speakers' conflicting assertions suggested some sensitivity to the kinds
of knowledge relevant for evaluating different adjectives.},

This paper reports evidence regarding (1) the nature of those environmental requirements, (2) the ways in which the varied social contexts in which children live meet those requirements, and (3) the effects of environmental variability in meeting those requirements on the course of language development. The evidence suggests that all human environments support language acquisition by providing children with opportunities for communicative experience, which motivate the language acquisition process, and a language model, which serves as data for the language acquisition mechanism. Different environments do so to different degrees, thereby producing group and individual differences in the rate and course of language development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Whereas much research has studied the characteristics of so-called infant-directed speech and speculated about its significance for language learning, research directly testing these ideas has been more limited until recently. Studies now suggest that infant-directed speech (a) promotes infant attention to language, (b) fosters social interaction between infants and caregivers, and (c) informs infants about various aspects of their native language by heightening distinctions relative to the speech addressed to adults. New developments focusing on the social role of infant-directed conversational interactions highlight the importance of caregiver responsiveness to the infant. Building a communicative foundation even prior to the time language emerges is crucial for fostering language development.},

It therefore presents a good testing ground of the interplay between speaker-oriented and addressee-oriented processes during reference production.

The Expectancy hypothesis suggests that during language comprehension, listeners focus their attention on discourse entities in proportion to their estimation of the likelihood that the entity will be mentioned. This has implications for understanding the role of audience design in reference production, because it provides a mechanism for communicative facilitation even when the producer did not explicitly intend it. The Expectancy hypothesis emerges out of the finding that the above- mentioned textual factors share an additional property: they are all correlated with a relatively higher likelihood of subsequent mention (Arnold, 1998; see also Arnold, Brown-Schmidt, {\&} Trueswell, 2007b; Arnold {\&} Tanenhaus, in press). For example, speakers and writers are more likely to refer back to something that was mentioned in subject position than things mentioned in non-subject position (Arnold, 1998), even when considering only utterances with more than one nominal argument or adjunct (Arnold, 1999). Similarly, speakers are more likely to refer to things in goal role than source role, things in parallel syntactic position, things in the focus position of clefts, and things that are recently mentioned (Arnold, 1998, 2001).
$\backslash$ldots Through experience with language, people learn that some things (e.g., those mentioned as subjects) are more likely to be continued in the discourse than others. By focusing their attention probabilistically on the more likely referents, they can facilitate comprehension of references to those entities$\backslash$ldots discourse entities vary in accessibility in a gradient way. It also predicts that referents should be perceived as more accessible in situations where textual or non-textual factors indicate that there is a higher likelihood that it will be mentioned, thus facilitating reference comprehension. The expectancy of discourse entities is likely to be represented in the nonlinguistic model of the situation, where expected entities have a higher level of activation (Arnold, 1998). That is, what is relevant is the likelihood of a referential event, not the likelihood of particular linguistic forms of reference. In this sense the Expectancy hypothesis contrasts with another model of linguistic predictability, Pick- ering and Garrod's (2007) production emulator, which models the predict- ability of linguistic forms and structures during lexical and syntactic processing. Thus, the Expectancy hypothesis predicts that reference to expected entities should be facilitated in comprehension, while the produc- tion emulator in its current form makes predictions about linguistic forms and structures. According to the Expectancy hypothesis, the calculation of expectancy
occurs for the comprehender, who uses referential expectancy as a proxy for the speaker's focus of attention. In other words, the way the speaker phrases things provides useful information to the listener about what the speaker is likely to keep talking about. A similar idea is represented in Centering theory's list of forward-looking centres, which constitute the set of likely topics in the immediately following discourse (e.g., Brennan, 1995; Grosz et al., 1995). But this just raises a new question about addressee design: why do speakers mark accessibility through their choices in phrasing?},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. This study compared the motivation and quality of experience of demograph-ically matched students from Montessori and traditional middle school programs. Approximately 290 students responded to the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and filled out questionnaires. Multivariate analyses showed that the Mon-tessori students reported greater affect, potency (i.e., feeling energetic), intrinsic motivation, flow experience, and undivided interest (i.e., the combination of high intrinsic motivation and high salience or importance) while engaged in academic activities at school. The traditional middle school students reported higher salience while doing academic work; however, such responses were often accompanied by low intrinsic motivation. When engaged in informal, non-academic activities, the students in both school contexts reported similar ex-periences. These results are discussed in terms of current thought on motivation in education and middle school reform.},

	Abstract = {Introduction. Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis, LB) is a systemic tick-borne disease. Its symptoms include dermatological changes and systemic manifestations such as musculoskeletal, neurologic, and cardiac. The etiologic agent of LB is a spirochete known as Borrelia burgdorferi (B.b.) with rodents and small mammals as its animal reservoir. In Poland, there are approximately 9-10 cases of the disease per 100,000 inhabitants each year. Objective. Analyis of the incidence of Lyme borreliosis and the clinical picture of the disease among foresters. Material and methods. The research material consisted of data collected in a diagnostic survey conducted by use of a survey questionnaire method. The study involved 100 randomly selected workers of the forest inspectorate in Podkarpackie Voivodeship. Group I consisted of men between 30-45 years old with an average length of service of 14 years (48{\%}); group II consisted of men between 45-55 years old with an average length of service of 24 years (52{\%}). Results. Only 25{\%} of the foresters from the first group, younger in age and with shorter service, had never been bitten by a tick, while 60{\%} were bitten once, and 15{\%} had been repeatedly bitten. In the second group, older in age and with longer service, only 3{\%} had never been bitten by a tick, 35{\%} were bitten once, while 62{\%} had been repeatedly bitten. LB was diagnosed in 30{\%} of the research participants from the first group and in 45{\%} from the second group. Most frequently, LB was diagnosed as a result of the presence of erythema migrans (55{\%}), ELISA test (20{\%}), and Western Blot test (22{\%}). The most frequent symptoms among the participants were: erythema migrans (45{\%}), fever and shivers (35{\%}), muscle pain and cramps (15{\%}), other symptoms (5{\%}). Permanent presence of symptoms was reported by 70{\%} of the participants, 25{\%} experienced symptoms periodically, and 5{\%} only sporadically. Conclusions. LB occurs more frequently among foresters older in age and with longer service (45{\%}); in the younger group - 30{\%}. Despite knowledge on preventive methods, there is no effective preventive method for this disease.},

	Abstract = {Musical group interaction (MGI) is a complex social setting requiring certain cognitive skills that may also elicit shared psychological states. We argue that many MGI-specific features may also be important for emotional empathy, the ability to experience another person's emotional state. We thus hypothesized that long-term repeated participation in MGI could help enhance a capacity for emotional empathy even outside of the musical context, through a familiarization with and refinement of MGI empathy-promoting musical components (EPMCs). We tested this hypothesis by designing an MGI programme for primary school children consisting of interactive musical games implementing various EPMCs. We ran the programme for an entire school year and compared the emotional empathy of MGI children to control children using existing and novel measures of empathy before and after the programme. Our results support our hypothesis: MGI children showed higher emotional empathy scores after the study compared to its beginning, and higher scores than control children at the end of the study. These findings shed new light on the emotional processes involved in musical interaction and highlight the remarkable potential of MGI for promoting positive social-emotional capacities such as empathy.},

In alcohol-induced amnestic syndrome, we consider alcohol-induced dementia, Korsakoff's psychosis, and Wernicke's encephalopathy as possible differential diagnoses. Impairments of perfusion of the brain tissue with a resulting hypoxia may occur in patients with a cardiac arrhytmia, and an implanted electronic cardiac pacemaker. The "pacemaker syndrome", which is not very well known in a common psychiatric practice, may rarely be accompanied by psychopathology. The clinical picture was similar in both presented cases, but there were some differences in the etiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis. The most important part of the treatment is to remove the cause of the disease.},

While few studies exist regarding child language reliability, fewer exist for adults. This study uses a test--retest procedure to examine frequency and reliability of morphosyntactic production in the language of 17 mothers interacting with their children. To examine reliability of different sample lengths, counts and reliability are calculated at 50, 100, 150 and 200 utterances. Results are compared to those of children (2;6--3;6) involved in a larger study and reported in previous work. Results show that (1) frequency counts were higher for adults than children, (2) reliability of most elements was markedly lower in adult language, and (3) relative frequency of items in the child language samples mirrored those in adult samples.},

I will argue that the pattern of distribution and interpretation of scalar adjectives in these contexts provides evidence for two sources for subjectivity, which are distinguished from each other in that one affects the grammatical properties of a predicate and one does not. The first kind, which licenses appearance in the complement position of find, is based in the lexical semantics of predicates that encode qualitative assessments. The second kind, which gives rise to faultless disagreement effects, arises from uncertainty about the dimensions of evaluation that are involved in fixing the extension of a predicate in a context of utterance.},

Here we explore the nature of children's language-based social preferences through research with children in South Africa, a multilingual nation. Like children in the United States, Xhosa South African children preferred speakers of their first language (Xhosa) to speakers of a foreign language (French). Thus, social preferences based on language are observed not only among children with limited exposure to cultural and linguistic variation but also among children living in a diverse linguistic environment. Moreover, Xhosa children attending school in English expressed social preferences for speakers of English over speakers of Xhosa, even when tested by a Xhosa-speaking experimenter. Thus, children's language-based social preferences do not depend exclusively on preferences for more familiar or intelligible speech but also extend to preferences for speech that may convey higher status in the child's society.},

How- ever, such studies have not employed dialogues that in- volve role swapping on a turn-by-turn basis. In our experiment, participants alternated in giving and follow- ing instructions to move objects around on a grid. They tended to repeat the syntactic form just used by their in- terlocutor, reflecting sensitivity to ease of production. More interestingly, they were more likely to disambiguate their utterances when the visual context was potentially ambiguous than when it was not, reflecting sensitivity to ease of comprehension. We conclude that speakers pay attention to their beliefs about their addressees' ease of comprehension, in addition to considering ease of pro- duction for themselves.},

	Annote = {HOW do children produce the behaviors that they do when they learn language?
-come prepared to learn
-but with what? general outline? set of processes that lead uniquely to LA? set of processes that lead to acq of any skill?
-Nativist position: plato's problem, poverty of the stimulus: not enough info in put to explain how learn lang, so process much be supported by innate syntactic knowledge and lang-spec learning procedures
- 2 claims: 1) at least some of principles underlying lang are lang-specific (not found in other cog processes, and 2) procedures that guide implementation of these principles are innate
- typically linked, but need not be: social cognitive accounts claim enough info in input, given context of supportive social environments in which they live, to induce a gramm system with few or none assumptions about the structure of the to-be-learned system
- resilient properties = ones where child developed gramm system when not exposed to any lang at all (props good candidates for innate structures that guide, either lang-specific or applicable to other cog tasks)
- environmental factors important - SES vocab gap widens until age 4, then remains relatively constant throughout school years
- env variations can affect pacing
- deaf children to hearing parents who don't expose them to conventional sign langguage develop homesign systems - applying lang-processing skills to at best limited data
- how far can child's info processing skills take her when applied to non-ling data?
- gestures that homesigner produce transparent representations of object, actions, attributes (point to entites in context to refer, and even empty spaces to refer to non-present entities)
- iconic gestures capturing features of referent (perceptual information, iconicity)
- introduce syntactic structure, even though not necessarily needed: gestures follow a consistent order (how represent events, availability)
- = contains structure comm partner doesn't need, suggesting structure not for them, but instead reflects how homesigners org thoughts for comm
- gestures composed of parts like morphemes (more efficient)
- not necessary for communication, but makes system productive
- nominal versus predicate gestures, where former does not vary with gramm context, but latter does, and systematically
- structures do not come from structures in input - hearing parents first produce complex sentences after child first produces them, and less often than their children
- properties of lang that appear in homesign not dev'd from input = "resilient", reflect biases humans bring to l-learning
(if kids are more constrained cog'ly, makes sense more structure because going to be producing even more based on what's available)
- biases could be lang-specific or recruited from general cog repertoire: sequentialize, chunk, embed...
- but why specific ones they do? handshapes rep size and shape of objects (not, e.g., weight, material)
- same properties grammaticized in spoken morphological systems
- chater: lang needs to conform to brain of learner (grammaticise things that are accessible to them)
- (concrete nouns learned earlier also in part because way they're referred to = most accessible dimension)
- general cognitive skills (ability to rep size and shape, rather than weight, texture, temperature) may play special role in human lang
- WHAT determines WHICH properties do and do not find way into homesign? what determines biases children bring to lang-learning?
- can look at conditions that foster fragile props of language: 
- increasing age: homesign systems get more complex as individuals age (introduce grammatical category of subject, systematic diffs in finger complexity in object vs handling handshapes)
- later cohorts fully gramaticise/generalize plural marking - becomes so only when passed to new generation of learners
- having community of signers appears to be essential for dev of mostly lexical properties (future work will need to determine whether having community necessary for emergence of any grammatical properties at all)
- "children are prepared to learn a communication system characterised by a number of resilient properties of language -- by simple syntactic structures (e.g., sentences containing elements that follow a consistent order, sentences containing words that are composed of parts, sentences containing elements that serve a nominal role, which are treated differently from elements that serve a predicate role); by hierarchical organisation (e.g., a complex nominal constituent embed- ded within a larger sentence, one proposition concatenated with another to form a complex sentence); by markers that modulate the meanings of sentences (e.g., negative and question markers); by functions that all conventional languages serve (e.g., making requests, commenting on the present and non-present, making generic statements, telling stories, talking to oneself, talking about talk)."

"Usage-based theories of language acquisition hold that children acquire language by applying general learning skills to patterns in their linguistic input. For example, according to Tomasello (2005, p. 186), ``children construct from their experience with a particular language some kinds of grammatical categories, based on the function of particular words and phrases in particular utterances -- followed by generalisations across these'' (see also Bybee {\&} McClelland, 2005; Goldberg {\&} Del Giudice, 2005). The findings described in the second half of this review
lend some support to these accounts. Variations in both the quantity and quality of the linguistic input to which children are exposed predict variations in child outcomes. Interestingly, input can play different roles in predicting child outcome depending upon which linguistic property is being learned (e.g., vocabulary or syntax) and who is doing the learning (e.g., whether the learner does or does not have brain injury). Finding a relation between variations in parent input and variations in child output does not, of course, tell us how the input is used by the language-learning child. Beginning with Saffran, Aslin, and Newport's(1996) seminal paper applying statistical learning to language learning, extensive work has been done exploring the processes by which children accumu- late descriptive statistics about their linguistic input and use those statistics to chunk the speech stream into units. Statistical learning is one of the processes that children apply to their linguistic input to discover the structures of their language. However, the homesign findings described in the first
half of this review make it clear that accounts of language learning that focus centrally on linguistic input tell only part of the story. A strict usage-based account would have to predict that, in the absence of linguistic input, a child
would not communicate in language-like ways since there would be no input from which to glean linguistic patterns. This prediction fails -- homesign, which is developed in the absence of linguistic input, contains many of the properties found in natural language (Goldin-Meadow, 2003a). More- over, the fact that children are excellent statistical learners does not explain how homesigners can incorporate struc- tures into their gestures that resemble natural language (but do not resemble the co-speech gestures their hearing parents use with them, Goldin-Meadow{\&}Mylander, 1983, 1998). Nor does it explain why learners sometimes change the linguistic input to which they are exposed (input from either a natural or an artificial language, e.g., Fedzechkina, Jaeger, {\&} Newport, 2012). Rather than being extracted from linguistic input, the
properties found in homesign appear to be imposed on human language by the communicator. They are thus good candidates for innate structures that guide the process of language learning. The homesign data do not tell us whether these structures are specific to language learning or more general cognitive structures that are applied to language even when there is no explicit model for doing so. The homesign data do, however, make it clear that children bring their own biases to language. These biases are difficult to see under typical language-learning cir- cumstances, but are put into bold relief when children, such as homesigners, are not exposed to linguistic input. If the structures that are characteristic of natural language appear in homesign, we then have good evidence that those structures are part of human language not only because they have been handed down from generation to generation, but also because this is the way humans are innately biased to structure their communication."},

Here we investigated possible factors which may explain the positive relationship between SFON and symbolic number development. Children aged 4-5 years (N = 130) completed a battery of tasks designed to assess SFON and a range of mathematical skills. Results showed that SFON was positively associated with children's symbolic numerical processing skills and their performance on a standardised test of arithmetic. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that the relationship between SFON and symbolic mathematics achievement can be explained, in part, by individual differences in children's nonsymbolic numerical processing skills and their ability to map between nonsymbolic and symbolic representations of number.},

An experimental manipulation which has previously been shown to reduce coalitional byproducts, such as race, but not affect dedicated dimensions, such as sex and age, was used to test between these two possibilities. Accent behaved like a dedicated dimension, remaining unaffected by the same coalitional manipulation that reduces categorization by race. A second study verified that the exact same coalitional manipulation used with accent in fact reduces categorization by race. These results suggest that accent is not a byproduct of coalitional psychology, unlike race.

Using natural language samples, we investigated whether similarity in dyads' use of function words, called language style matching (LSM), predicts outcomes for romantic relationships. In Study 1, greater LSM in transcripts of 40 speed dates predicted increased likelihood of mutual romantic interest (odds ratio = 3.05). Overall, 33.3{\%} of pairs with LSM above the median mutually desired future contact, compared with 9.1{\%} of pairs with LSM at or below the median. In Study 2, LSM in 86 couples' instant messages positively predicted relationship stability at a 3-month follow-up (odds ratio = 1.95). Specifically, 76.7{\%} of couples with LSM greater than the median were still dating at the follow-up, compared with 53.5{\%} of couples with LSM at or below the median. LSM appears to reflect implicit interpersonal processes central to romantic relationships.},

We evaluated whether speakers can explicitly control such leakage in light of its communicative consequences. Speakers described mutually known objects (e.g., a triangle) that had size-contrasting matches that were privileged to the speakers (e.g., a larger triangle visible to the speakers only), so that use of a contrasting adjective (e.g., small) involved referring to the privileged information. Half the time, speakers were instructed to conceal the identity of the privileged object. If speakers can control their leaked references to privileged information, this conceal instruction should make such references less likely. Surprisingly, the conceal instruction caused speakers to refer to privileged objects more than they did in the baseline condition. Thus, not only do speakers have difficulty not leaking privileged information, but attempts to avoid such leakage only make it more likely.},

	Abstract = {Concerns that the growing competition for funding and citations might distort science are frequently discussed, but have not been verified directly. Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientific literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have ``tested'' a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22{\%} between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with which results are produced and published is decreasing.},

Infants preferred grammatical sentences over ungrammatical sentences when the ungrammaticality was cued by both misplaced inflection and word order reversal of nouns and verbs. Infants were also sensitive to inflection alone as a cue to grammaticality, but not word order alone. The preference for grammatical sentence forms was also disrupted when adjacent function word cues were removed from the stimuli, and when familiar contentwords were replaced by nonce words. These results suggest that sensitivity to the relationship between functional morphemes and content words, rather than sensitivity to either independ- ently, drives the development of early grammatical knowledge. Furthermore, infants showed some ability to generalize from familiar to nonce content word contexts.},

	Abstract = {Many elementary teachers have been found to have high levels of mathematics anxiety but the impact on student achievement was unknown. Elementary teachers (N = 692) completed the modified Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale-Revised (Hopko, 2003) along with a questionnaire probing anxiety about teaching mathematics and current mathematics instructional practices. Student mathematics achievement data were collected for the classrooms taught by the teachers. A positive relationship was found between anxiety about mathematics and anxiety about teaching mathematics. Increased student mathematics achievement was related to lower levels of anxiety about teaching mathematics, but was not related to general anxiety about mathematics. Anxiety about mathematics was positively related to more National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards-based instructional practices. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT---Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)$\backslash$nstudies of emotion, personality, and social cognition have$\backslash$ndrawn much attention in recent years, with high-profile$\backslash$nstudies frequently reporting extremely high (e.g., {\textgreater}.8) correlations$\backslash$nbetween brain activation and personalitymeasures.$\backslash$nWe show that these correlations are higher than should be$\backslash$nexpected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI$\backslash$nand personality measures. The high correlations are all the$\backslash$nmore puzzling because method sections rarely contain much$\backslash$ndetail about howthe correlationswere obtained.We surveyed$\backslash$nauthors of 55 articles that reported findings of this kind to$\backslash$ndetermine a few details on how these correlations were$\backslash$ncomputed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy$\backslash$nthat computes separate correlations for individual voxels and$\backslash$nreports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds.$\backslash$nWe show how this nonindependent analysis inflates$\backslash$ncorrelations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams.$\backslash$nThis analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority$\backslash$nof the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In$\backslash$naddition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems$\backslash$nlikely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline$\backslash$nhow the data from these studies could be reanalyzed$\backslash$nwith unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the$\backslash$ncorrelations in question and urge authors to perform such$\backslash$nreanalyses. The underlying problems described here appear$\backslash$nto be common in fMRI research of many kinds---not just in$\backslash$nstudies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.},

	Abstract = {The beliefs people hold about the social and physical world are central to self-definition and social interaction. The current research analyzes reasoning about three kinds of beliefs: those that concern matters of fact (e.g., dinosaurs are extinct), preference (e.g., green is the prettiest color), and ideology (e.g., there is only one God). The domain of ideology is of unique interest because it is hypothesized to contain elements of both facts and preferences. If adults' distinct reasoning about ideological beliefs is the result of prolonged experience with the physical and social world, children and adults should reveal distinct patterns of differentiating kinds of beliefs, and this difference should be particularly pronounced with respect to ideological beliefs. On the other hand, if adults' reasoning about beliefs is a basic component of social cognition, children and adults should demonstrate similar belief representations and patterns of belief differentiation. Two experiments demonstrate that 5--10 year old children and adults similarly judged religious beliefs to be intermediate between factual beliefs (where two disagreeing people cannot both be right) and preferences (where they can). From the age of 5 years and continuing into adulthood, individuals distinguished ideological beliefs from other types of mental states and demonstrated limited tolerance for belief-based disagreements.},

	Abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) provide an account of Bayesian inference in a hierarchically structured hypothesis space. Scientific theories are plausibly regarded as organized into hierarchies in many cases, with higher levels sometimes called 'paradigms' and lower levels encoding more specific or concrete hypotheses. Therefore, HBMs provide a useful model for scientific theory change, showing how higher-level theory change may be driven by the impact of evidence on lower levels. HBMs capture features described in the Kuhnian tradition, particularly the idea that higher-level theories guide learning at lower levels. In addition, they help resolve certain issues for Bayesians, such as scientific preference for simplicity and tbe problem of new theories.},

	Abstract = {People's fear and anxiety about doing math--over and above actual math ability--can be an impediment to their math achievement. We show that when the math-anxious individuals are female elementary school teachers, their math anxiety carries negative consequences for the math achievement of their female students. Early elementary school teachers in the United States are almost exclusively female ({\textgreater}90{\%}), and we provide evidence that these female teachers' anxieties relate to girls' math achievement via girls' beliefs about who is good at math. First- and second-grade female teachers completed measures of math anxiety. The math achievement of the students in these teachers' classrooms was also assessed. There was no relation between a teacher's math anxiety and her students' math achievement at the beginning of the school year. By the school year's end, however, the more anxious teachers were about math, the more likely girls (but not boys) were to endorse the commonly held stereotype that "boys are good at math, and girls are good at reading" and the lower these girls' math achievement. Indeed, by the end of the school year, girls who endorsed this stereotype had significantly worse math achievement than girls who did not and than boys overall. In early elementary school, where the teachers are almost all female, teachers' math anxiety carries consequences for girls' math achievement by influencing girls' beliefs about who is good at math.},

	Abstract = {We investigate whether preschoolers' word learning is selectively attuned to learning word-referent links that they expect will be relevant to their everyday communicative contexts. In two studies, 4-year-olds were taught the name of an unfamiliar toy that they were told was purchased either nearby or faraway. Children's memory for the link was assessed either by a speaker who was not present when it was taught or by the same speaker who taught it to them. Children who were told that the toys were from nearby learned the word-referent link, whereas children who were told the toys were from faraway did not. Our findings suggest that 4-year-olds' word learning is " attuned to relevance" - they selectively acquire new word meanings that will have communicative utility in their linguistic community. These findings provide the first evidence that children's selective word learning is driven by an overarching principle of prospective relevance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Advances in a wide range of biological, behavioral, and social sciences are expanding our understanding of how early environmental influences (the ecology) and genetic predispositions (the biologic program) affect learning capacities, adaptive behaviors, lifelong physical and mental health, and adult productivity. A supporting technical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) presents an integrated ecobiodevelopmental framework to assist in translating these dramatic advances in developmental science into improved health across the life span. Pediatricians are now armed with new information about the adverse effects of toxic stress on brain development, as well as a deeper understanding of the early life origins of many adult diseases. As trusted authorities in child health and development, pediatric providers must now complement the early identification of developmental concerns with a greater focus on those interventions and community investments that reduce external threats to healthy brain growth. To this end, AAP endorses a developing leadership role for the entire pediatric community-one that mobilizes the scientific expertise of both basic and clinical researchers, the family-centered care of the pediatric medical home, and the public influence of AAP and its state chapters-to catalyze fundamental change in early childhood policy and services. AAP is committed to leveraging science to inform the development of innovative strategies to reduce the precipitants of toxic stress in young children and to mitigate their negative effects on the course of development and health across the life span.},

	Abstract = {The capacity to keep multiple items in short-term memory (STM) improves over childhood and provides the foundation for the development of multiple cognitive abilities. The goal of this study was to measure the extent to which age differences in STM capacity are related to differences in task engagement during encoding. Children (n = 69, mean age = 10.6 years) and adults (n = 54, mean age = 27.5 years) performed two STM tasks: the forward digit span test from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and a novel eyetracking digit span task designed to overload STM capacity. Building on prior research showing that task-evoked pupil dilation can be used as a real-time index of task engagement, we measured changes in pupil dilation while participants encoded long sequences of digits for subsequent recall. As expected, adults outperformed children on both STM tasks. We found similar patterns of pupil dilation while children and adults listened to the first six digits on our STM overload task, after which the adults' pupils continued to dilate and the children's began to constrict, suggesting that the children had reached their cognitive limits and that they had begun to disengage from the task. Indeed, the point at which pupil dilation peaked at encoding was a significant predictor of WISC forward span, and this relationship held even after partialing out recall performance on the STM overload task. These findings indicate that sustained task engagement at encoding is an important component of the development of STM.},

	Abstract = {Language experience shapes infants' abilities to process speech sounds, with universal phonetic discrimination abilities narrowing in the second half of the first year. Brain measures reveal a corresponding change in neural discrimination as the infant brain becomes selectively sensitive to its native language(s). Whether and how bilingual experience alters the transition to native language specific phonetic discrimination is important both theoretically and from a practical standpoint. Using whole head magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examined brain responses to Spanish and English syllables in Spanish-English bilingual and English monolingual 11-month-old infants. Monolingual infants showed sensitivity to English, while bilingual infants were sensitive to both languages. Neural responses indicate that the dual sensitivity of the bilingual brain is achieved by a slower transition from acoustic to phonetic sound analysis, an adaptive and advantageous response to increased variability in language input. Bilingual neural responses extend into the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, which may be related to their previously described bilingual advantage in executive function skills.

@article{Butler2014,
	Abstract = {In constructing a conceptual understanding of the world, children must actively evaluate what information is idiosyncratic or superficial, and what represents essential, defining information about kinds and categories. Preschoolers observed identical evidence about a novel object's function (magnetism) produced in subtly different manners: accidentally, intentionally, or demonstrated communicatively and pedagogically. Only when evidence was explicitly demonstrated for their benefit did children reliably go beyond salient perceptual features (color or shape), to infer function to be a defining property on which to base judgments about category membership. Children did not show this pattern when reasoning about a novel perceptual property, suggesting that a pedagogical communicative context may be especially important for children's learning about artifact functions. Observing functional evidence in a pedagogical context helps children construct fundamentally different conceptions of novel categories as defined not by superficial appearances but by deeper, functional properties. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{OKeefe1978a,
	Abstract = {14.1. Introduction Any model of hippocampal function must account not only for data from the rat, cat, and monkey, it must make sense of data gathered in the clinic as well. For over 20 years it has been known that the hippocampus is essential in human long-term memory function, and the inability of investigators to find adequate parallels to this function in other species led to the unfortunate tendency to assume that there were major species differences regarding hippocampal function. With the advantage of hindsight we can see that this discrepancy between clinical and experimental work resulted from two related factors: (1) an inaccurate conceptualization of the nature of the memory deficit consequent upon hippocampal damage in humans, embedded within a similar set of misconceptions concerning the nature of normal human memory; (2) the use of inappropriate paradigms in work with infra-humans, which generally failed to assess the same aspects of memory affected by hippocampal damage in humans. We have argued elsewhere (Nadel and O'Keefe 1974) that there is no valid reason to assume that differences of large magnitude exist between mammalian species in regard to the function of specific brain areas, and we are thus in strong agreement with the recent tendency to bring the clinical and experimental work together under the same theoretical umbrella (cf. Isaacson and Pribram 1975). In the first section of the book we established the basis for the theory of cognitive mapping by considering data from a variety of species, including humans. Impressive evidence for the existence of spatial mapping comes from recent work with humans, while the philosophical background to the problem of space perception rests almost entirely on considerations of the proper basis for human knowledge. The cognitive map in infra-humans should be viewed as a spatial map in which representations of objects experienced in the environment are ordered within a framework generating a unitary space. However, the central property of the locale system is its ability to order representations in a structured context. The development of objective spatial representations is not the only possible use for such a system. We hope to show, in this final section of the book, that mapping structures can represent verbal, Extension of the theory to humans 381 as well as non-verbal, information. For both of these forms the locale system will be shown to be central to a particular form of memory: that concerned with the representation of experiences within a specific context. We shall argue that memory comes in two basic varieties: (1) memory for items, independent of the time or place of their occurrence; (2) memory for items or events within a spatio-temporal context. *},

@article{Siegal1999,
	Abstract = {According to Piagetian accounts of cognitive development, children's responses on many tasks reflect the lack of evidence for an operational competence that is conceptual rather than linguistic. In this paper, I show that such accounts assume that young children are endowed with substantial conversational wizardry, allowing them to interpret questions about cognitive tasks as intended by the experimenter. Once it is explicitly recognized that children may be less advanced in their conversational awareness than is commonly assumed, their competence can be assessed more accurately. Recent and new evidence from a variety of sources, such as research on conservation, suggestibility in memory, and theory of mind understanding in deaf and hearing children, converges to indicate that competence is inadequately characterized by a dichotomy between pre-operational and operational logic and that what is developing in children's cognition is a complex interplay between both conversational and conceptual processes. This evidence is not merely relevant to methodological concerns. It demands a radical shift in cognitive developmental theory and research to account for the importance of children's conversational awareness.

We also argue that ambiguity allows for greater ease of processing by permitting efficient linguistic units to be re-used. We test predictions of this theory in English, German, and Dutch. Our results and theoretical analysis suggest that ambiguity is a functional property of language that allows for greater communicative efficiency. This provides theoretical and empirical arguments against recent suggestions that core features of linguistic systems are not designed for communication.},
	Annote = {Ambiguity pervasive phenomenon
words have multiple senses, syntactic categories
morphemes
homophones
syllables provide incomplete info about word speaker intending to communicate
syntactic, semantic ambiguity

puzzle for functionalist theories explaining properties of linguistic systems in terms of communicative pressures 

if language perfectly disambiguated meaning, one word, one meaning, comm efficacy enhanced, no danger of misunderstanding

existence of ambiguity itself used to argue that lang did not evolve for comm

ambiguity desirable property because allows for compact system
1) where context informative, unambiguous language inefficient because partly redundant with it
2) allows re-use of sounds and words more easily produced or understood

ambiguity fits within framework of principle of least effort

speakers can mimize effort if all meanings are expressed by one maximally ambiguous word

listeners can minimize effort if all meanings are expressed by distinct linguistic forms

Zipf: natural langs will strike balance between unification and diversification, some but not total ambiguity
- observed in balance between freq of words and number of words
law of meaning distribution: number of meanings a word has should scale with square root of its frequency

but characterizing as trade-off between speaker and hearer pressures inaccurate: totally ambiguous lang does not minimize speaker effort because have to clarigy 

basic intuition, that results from a rational process of communication, fundamentally correct, but tradeoff actually between clarity and ease

clear comm system = intended meaning recoverable with high prob
easy comm system = signals efficiently produced, communicated, and processed

ease for human lang...short, frequent, phonotactically well-formed words
- opposed with clarity, though, because limited number of easy signals that can be used
trade-off toward clarity: NATO alphabet
trade-off toward ease: pronouns

Ferrer i Cancho {\&} Loreto: necessary precondition of combinatorial systems, since combining multiple units has no advantage when each unambiguously communicates a full meaning

ambiguity rarely harmful in practice thanks to comprehender's ability to effectively disambiguate

desirable feature when context informative about meaning

Information-theoretic view of ambiguity
M possible meanings
ling form ambiguous if can map to more than one possible meaning

uncertainty listeners would have about intended meaning: Shannon entropy
amount of info required to disambiguate which meaning 

when p(m) - 1, no info needs to be transmitted, and entropy is 0
when entropy high, more bits needed
maximal uncertainty when meanings equally likely

prob distribution of p(m) may depend on context...all extralinguistic factors (discourse context, world context, world knowledge...) variable C
can then measure entropy of M, conditioned on C
entropy over meanings in particular context then weighted by a distribution p(c) on contexts, making H[M|C] expected entropy over meanings, in context
IF C is informative about meaning, then entropy of meaning in context is necessarily going to be lower than entropy of meaning alone

optimally efficient communication system will not convey unecessary info
least amount of info language can convey without being ambiguous in context is H[M|C] --{\textgreater} NEVER BE ABLE TO DISAMBIGUATE LANG OUT OF CONTEXT

-key assumption that is required is that speakers and listen- ers have the same---or very similar---coding schemes (cor- responding to similar probabilistic models of language and the world), and also the same ability to use contextual information to constrain the possible meanings.

Second argument: ambiguity desirable because allows for greater overall ease of processing
extend to case where codes vary in their difficulty for lang processing systems

If l1 is easier than l2, and m1 and m2 are well-disambiguated by context, then we can always create a linguistic system which is easier overall by map- ping m1 and m2 both to l1

Levinson (2000) assumes that this situa- tion results from a trade-off between hearer and speaker pressures, and moreover argues that human cognitive abil- ities will favor communication systems which are heavy on hearer inference and light on speaker effort.
The essential asymmetry is: inference is cheap, articula- tion expensive, and thus the design requirements are for a system that maximizes inference. (Hence ... lin- guistic coding is to be thought of less like definitive content content and more like interpretive clue.) (Levinson, 2000 p. 29)

--{\textgreater} hearers are good
at disambiguating in context, so effort speaker makes to express a distinction that could have been inferred is wasted effort

Prediction: linguistic units which req less effort should be more ambiguous
measure props of words and syllables which should influence their ease of processing, and see if easier linguistic units are preferentially reused in lang

length, freq, phonotactic prob

predict any measure that increases processing ease should also increase ambiguity

count number of possible meanings as measure of degree of ambiguity

Homophones in CELEX 
Polysemy in CELEX
factors which should increase ease also increase number of senses

	Abstract = {Previous studies have found that talkers converge or diverge in phonetic form during a single conversational session or as a result of long-term exposure to a particular linguistic environment. In the current study, five pairs of previously unacquainted male roommates were recorded at four time intervals during the academic year. Phonetic convergence over time was assessed using a perceptual similarity test and measures of vowel spectra. There were distinct patterns of phonetic convergence during the academic year across roommate pairs, and perceptual detection of convergence varied for different linguistic items. In addition, phonetic convergence correlated moderately with roommates' self-reported closeness. These findings suggest that phonetic convergence in college roommates is variable and moderately related to the strength of a relationship. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 One way that languages are able to communicate a potentially infinite set of ideas through a finite lexicon is by compressing emerging meanings into words, such that over time, individual words come to express multiple, related senses of meaning. We propose that overarching communicative and cognitive pressures have created systematic directionality in how new metaphorical senses have developed from existing word senses over the history of English. Given a large set of pairs of semantic domains, we used computational models to test which domains have been more commonly the starting points (source domains) and which the ending points (target domains) of metaphorical mappings over the past millennium. We found that a compact set of variables, including externality, embodiment, and valence, explain directionality in the majority of about 5000 metaphorical mappings recorded over the past 1100 years. These results provide the first large-scale historical evidence that metaphorical mapping is systematic, and driven by measurable communicative and cognitive principles.},

Instead, by making the assumption that speakers choose their words to be informative in context, listeners routinely make pragmatic inferences that go beyond the linguistic data. If language learners make these same assumptions, they should be able to infer word meanings in otherwise ambiguous situations. We use probabilistic tools to formalize these kinds of informativeness inferences-extending a model of pragmatic language comprehension to the acquisition setting-and present four experiments whose data suggest that preschool children can use informativeness to infer word meanings and that adult judgments track quantitatively with informativeness.},

@article{Wood2016,
	Abstract = {Theoretical models of social learning predict that individuals can benefit from using strategies that specify when and whom to copy. Here the interaction of two social learning strategies, model age-based biased copying and copy when uncertain, was investigated. Uncertainty was created via a systematic manipulation of demonstration efficacy (completeness) and efficiency (causal relevance of some actions). The participants, 4- to 6-year-old children (N = 140), viewed both an adult model and a child model, each of whom used a different tool on a novel task. They did so in a complete condition, a near-complete condition, a partial demonstration condition, or a no-demonstration condition. Half of the demonstrations in each condition incorporated causally irrelevant actions by the models. Social transmission was assessed by first responses but also through children's continued fidelity, the hallmark of social traditions. Results revealed a bias to copy the child model both on first response and in continued interactions. Demonstration efficacy and efficiency did not affect choice of model at first response but did influence solution exploration across trials, with demonstrations containing causally irrelevant actions decreasing exploration of alternative methods. These results imply that uncertain environments can result in canalized social learning from specific classes of model.},

@article{Cukur2013,
	Abstract = {Little is known about how attention changes the cortical representation of sensory information in humans. On the basis of neurophysiological evidence, we hypothesized that attention causes tuning changes to expand the representation of attended stimuli at the cost of unattended stimuli. To investigate this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure how semantic representation changed during visual search for different object categories in natural movies. We found that many voxels across occipito-temporal and fronto-parietal cortex shifted their tuning toward the attended category. These tuning shifts expanded the representation of the attended category and of semantically related, but unattended, categories, and compressed the representation of categories that were semantically dissimilar to the target. Attentional warping of semantic representation occurred even when the attended category was not present in the movie; thus, the effect was not a target-detection artifact. These results suggest that attention dynamically alters visual representation to optimize processing of behaviorally relevant objects during natural vision.},

@article{Walker2016,
	Abstract = {We explore the developmental trajectory and underlying mechanisms of abstract relational reasoning. We describe a surprising developmental pattern: Younger learners are better than older ones at inferring abstract causal relations. Walker and Gopnik (2014) demonstrated that toddlers are able to infer that an effect was caused by a relation between two objects (whether they are the same or different), rather than by individual kinds of objects. While these findings are consistent with evidence that infants recognize same-different relations, they contrast with a large literature suggesting that older children tend to have difficulty inferring these relations. Why might this be? In Experiment 1a, we demonstrate that while younger children (18???30-month-olds) have no difficulty learning these relational concepts, older children (36???48-month-olds) fail to draw this abstract inference. Experiment 1b replicates the finding with 18???30-month-olds using a more demanding intervention task. Experiment 2 tests whether this difference in performance might be because older children have developed the general hypothesis that individual kinds of objects are causal ??? the high initial probability of this alternative hypothesis might override the data that favors the relational hypothesis. Providing additional information falsifying the alternative hypothesis improves older children's performance. Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrates that prompting for explanations during learning also improves performance, even without any additional information. These findings are discussed in light of recent computational and algorithmic theories of learning.},

	Abstract = {To what extent do speaker-external communicative pressures versus speaker-internal cognitive pressures affect utterance form? Four experiments measured speakers' references to privately known (i.e., privileged) objects when naming mutually known (i.e., common ground) objects. Although speaker-external communicative pressures demanded that speakers avoid references to privileged objects, two experiments showed that speakers often ignored this demand when it co-existed with a speaker-internal pressure to attend to those privileged objects. We hypothesize that this was due to increased salience of privileged objects (a speaker-internal pressure). Experiment 3 showed that directly boosting the salience of privileged objects increased the likelihood that speakers will inappropriately refer to those objects. Experiment 4 showed that the salience-sensitive mechanism in Experiments 1 and 2 is likely related to the mechanism causing such references in Experiment 3. Thus, the language production system is especially sensitive to cognitive pressures even when communicative harm results.},

Failure to be selective would waste precious computational resources on material that is already known (too simple) or unknowable (too complex). In two experiments with 7- and 8-month-olds, we measure infants' visual attention to sequences of events varying in complexity, as determined by an ideal learner model. Infants' probability of looking away was greatest on stimulus items whose complexity (negative log probability) according to the model was either very low or very high. These results suggest a principle of infant attention that may have broad applicability: infants implicitly seek to maintain intermediate rates of information absorption and avoid wasting cognitive resources on overly simple or overly complex events.},

The effect on knowledge of numerical magnitudes was predicted to be larger when the game was played with a linear board than with a circular board because of a more direct mapping between the linear board and the desired mental representation. As predicted, playing the linear board game for roughly 1 hr increased low-income preschoolers' proficiency on the 2 tasks that directly measured understanding of numerical magnitudes---numerical magnitude comparison and number line estimation---more than playing the game with a circular board or engaging in other numerical activities. Also as predicted, children who had played the linear number board game generated more correct answers and better quality errors in response to subsequent training on arithmetic problems, a task hypothesized to be influenced by knowledge of numerical magnitudes. Thus, playing linear number board games not only increases preschoolers' numerical knowledge but also helps them learn from future numerical experiences.},

But young children also seem to learn many of their words in polyadic situations through overhearing. Extending the previous work of Akhtar and colleagues, in the current two studies we gave 18-month-old infants opportunities to acquire novel words through overhearing in situations that were a bit more complex: they did not socially interact with the adult who used the new word before the word learning situation began, and the way the adult used the new word was less transparent in that it was neither a naming nor a directive speech act. In both studies, infants learned words equally well (and above chance) whether they were directly addressed or had to eavesdrop on two adults. Almost from the beginning, young children employ diverse learning strategies for acquiring new words. Keywords},

	Abstract = {This paper considers a number of perspectives on the notion of ownership of language and languages. It argues that from the point of view of law and legal theory there is no reason in principle why a language cannot be owned. Two conceptualizations of language ownership are discussed. The first is the `liberal' view, which sees language as an open-access unstructured space. This is publicly or collectively owned in the sense that it is `non-property'. The second is the mother tongue--native speaker model, which views language as the property of the ethnos, and understands it as highly structured, relatively closed space, to which native speakers have privileged access. On the `liberal view', it would be wrong in principle to `enclose' an entire language, or grant a monopoly right over it, and at most limited privatization is justified for the purposes of copyright and trademark law, i.e. to protect economic rights. For the mother tongue--native speaker model, the idea of language rights represents one form of recognition of a language as property. For the indigenous languages of face-to-face ethnic communities, a form of monopoly ownership has been argued as a serious option, though the exact form of the ownership and the nature of the intellectual property rights involved remain unclear. Finally the question is posed as to the language politics that follow from the integrationist view that languages are `myths' or `constructs'.},

	Abstract = {Learning, the foundation of adaptive and intelligent behavior, is based on plastic changes in neural assemblies, reflected by the modulation of electric brain responses. In infancy, auditory learning implicates the formation and strengthening of neural long-term memory traces, improving discrimination skills, in particular those forming the prerequisites for speech perception and understanding. Although previous behavioral observations show that newborns react differentially to unfamiliar sounds vs. familiar sound material that they were exposed to as fetuses, the neural basis of fetal learning has not thus far been investigated. Here we demonstrate direct neural correlates of human fetal learning of speech-like auditory stimuli. We presented variants of words to fetuses; unlike infants with no exposure to these stimuli, the exposed fetuses showed enhanced brain activity (mismatch responses) in response to pitch changes for the trained variants after birth. Furthermore, a significant correlation existed between the amount of prenatal exposure and brain activity, with greater activity being associated with a higher amount of prenatal speech exposure. Moreover, the learning effect was generalized to other types of similar speech sounds not included in the training material. Consequently, our results indicate neural commitment specifically tuned to the speech features heard before birth and their memory representations.},

	Abstract = {Self-directed learning is often associated with better long-term memory retention; however, the mechanisms that underlie this advantage remain poorly understood. This series of experiments was designed to "deconstruct" the notion of self-directed learning, in order to better identify the factors most responsible for these improvements to memory. In particular, we isolated the memory advantage that comes from controlling the content of study episodes from the advantage that comes from controlling the timing of those episodes. Across four experiments, self-directed learning significantly enhanced recognition memory, relative to passive observation. However, the advantage for self-directed learning was found to be present even under extremely minimal conditions of volitional control (simply pressing a button when a participant was ready to advance to the next item). Our results suggest that improvements to memory following self-directed encoding may be related to the ability to coordinate stimulus presentation with the learner's current preparatory or attentional state, and they highlight the need to consider the range of cognitive control processes involved in and influenced by self-directed study.},

We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47{\%} of original effect sizes were in the 95{\%} confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39{\%} of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68{\%} with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

@article{Eaves1989,
	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Henrich2010,
	Abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers - often implicitly - assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these "standard subjects" are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species - frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior - hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

Children were either read the same story repeatedly or different stories and either napped after the stories or remained awake. Children's word retention were tested 2.5 h later, 24 h later, and 7 days later. Results demonstrate strong, persistent effects for both repeated readings and sleep consolidation on young children's word learning. A key finding is that children who read different stories before napping learned words as well as children who had the advantage of hearing the same story. In contrast, children who read different stories and remained awake never caught up to their peers on later word learning tests. Implications for educational practices are discussed.},

Hypothesize based on lure-retrieval task that children equally successful in forming generalizations based on experimenter-generated and self-generated evidence.




Three-year-old children were provided with either a training experience in which an experimenter demonstrated the activations of three different categories of machines (Training condition), or a play opportunity in which children could freely interact with the different machines (Free Play condition). They were then asked to make first-order generalizations, where they had to choose from a new set of blocks to activate a previously seen machine, and second-order generalizations, where they had to choose from a new set of blocks to activate a novel machine. Success in the Free Play condition would suggest that young children can generate evidence to support their learning, indicating an early capacity for active learning




Four categories of machines with distinct shapes and colors, produced distinct effects when activated




Training: 3 trays w activator blocks
Free play: 3 bins with machines and activator blocks




Training Condition
To begin the training phase, the experimenter presented a white tray containing three blocks differing in shape and color. The child was free to play with these blocks for about 20 seconds. After this exploration, the blocks were returned onto the tray and pulled close to the experimenter, but remained visible to the child. The experimenter then presented the first toy machine(e.g. blue rectangular machine), and activated the machine with one of the three blocks by placing it on top of the machine (e.g. red rectangular block, if the machines were being activated by a shape rule; blue triangular block, if the machines were being activated by a color rule). Upon the machine's activation, the experimenter drew attention to the event by saying, ``Look! The block made the machine go; it made it go!'' The experimenter next showed the child another machine that was identical to the first one, and activated it using the same block. This first set of two machines was then cleared from the table. The experimenter repeated this procedure with two other sets of training machines, activating them with their respective shape-match or color-match blocks.




three categories of machines chosen as the training set were randomized, leaving the fourth category ofmachines for the test phase (i.e. each category could be used as a training machine or a test machine)},

That is, a construction X which occurs 50{\%} of the time in the absence of priming would occur 63{\%} if primed without lexical repetition and 77{\%} of the time if primed with lexical repetition. The syntactic priming effect is robust across several different construction types and languages, and we found strong effects of lexical overlap on the size of the priming effect as well as interactions between lexical repetition and temporal lag and between lexical repetition and whether the priming occurred within or across languages. We also analyzed the distribution of p-values across experiments in order to estimate the average statistical power of experiments in our sample and to assess publication bias. Analyzing a subset of experiments in which the primary result of interest is whether a particular structure showed a priming effect, we did not find evidence of major p-hacking and the studies appear to have acceptable statistical power: 82{\%}. However, analyzing a subset of experiments that focus not just on whether syntactic priming exists but on how syntactic priming is moderated by other variables (such as repetition of words in prime and target, the location of the testing room, and the memory of the speaker), we found that such studies are, on average, underpowered with estimated average power of 53{\%}. Using a subset of 45 papers from our sample for which we received raw data, we estimated subject and item variation and give recommendations for appropriate sample size for future syntactic priming studies.},

	Abstract = {Ninety children's books (half for 3$\pm$4-year-olds and half for 5$\pm$6-year-olds) were analyzed for references to mental state in three ways: (a) via words and expressions in the text, (b) via the pictures, and (c) via ironic situations. Books for older children were significantly longer than the books for younger children, and overall, they included both a higher frequency of mental state references and a wider variety of such references. However, the rate of textual references to mental state was high for both groups, with a mental state token occurring on average every three sentences in books for both age groups. Moreover, the rate at which new types of mental state references appeared was also high; about every second token represented a new type of mental state reference. Pictures typically failed to represent independently the mental state concepts expressed in the text, but pictures and text together conveyed situational irony in over one-third of the books. Thus, mental state information was largely conveyed via words and irony. These findings suggest that storybook reading may provide even young children with a rich context for developing an understanding of mind.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} This study analyzes how others engage rural and urban Mozambican infants during naturalistic observations, and how the proportion of time spent in different engagements relates to infants' language development over the second year of life. Using an extended version of Bakeman and Adamson's (1984) categorization of infant engagement, we investigated to what extent a detailed analysis of infant engagement can contribute to our understanding of vocabulary development in natural settings. In addition, we explored how the different infant engagements relate to vocabulary size, and how these differ between the two communities. Results show that rural infants spend significantly more time in forms of solitary engagement, whereas urban infants spend more time in forms of triadic joint engagement. In regard to correlations with reported productive vocabulary, we find that dyadic {\textless}sc{\textgreater}persons{\textless}/sc{\textgreater} engagement (i.e. interactions {\textless}sc{\textgreater}not{\textless}/sc{\textgreater} about concrete objects) has positive correlations with vocabulary measures in both rural and urban communities. In addition, we find that triadic {\textless}sc{\textgreater}coordinated joint attention{\textless}/sc{\textgreater} has a positive relationship with vocabulary in the urban community, but a contrasting negative correlation with vocabulary in the rural community. These similarities and differences are explained, based upon the parenting beliefs and socialization practices of different prototypical learning environments. Overall, this study concludes that the extended categorization provides a valuable contribution to the analysis of infant engagement and their relation to language acquisition, especially for analyzing naturalistic observations as compared to semi-structured studies. Moreover, with respect to vocabulary development, Mozambican infants appear to benefit strongest from dyadic Persons engagement, while they do not necessarily benefit from joint attention, as tends to be the case for children from industrial, developed communities. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This article defines ``pedagogical questions'' as questions for which the questioner already knows the answer and intended to help the questionee learn. Transcripts of parent--child conversations were collected from the CHILDES database to examine the frequency and distribution of pedagogical questions. Analysis of 2,166 questions from 166 mother--child dyads and 64 father--child dyads (child's age between 2 and 6 years) showed that pedagogical questions are commonplace during day-to-day parent--child conversa- tions and vary based on child's age, family environment, and historical era. The results serve as a first step toward understanding the role of parent--child questions in facilitating children's learning.},

In particular, in formation-theoretic and psycholinguistic considerations suggest that this may inc lude maximizing the uni- formity of information density in an utterance. We investig ate this possibility in the context of syntactic reduction , where the speaker has the option of either marking a higher-order unit (a phrase) with an extra word, or leaving it unmarked. We demonstrate that speakers are more likely to reduce less i nformation-dense phrases. In a second step, we combine a stochastic model of st ructured utterance production with a logistic-regression model of syntactic r eduction to study which types of cues speakers employ when estimating the predictab ility of upcoming elements. We demonstrate that the trend toward predictabil ity-sensitive syntactic reduction (Jaeger, 2006) is robust in the face of a wide varie ty of control vari- ables, and present evidence that speakers use both surface a nd structural cues for predictability estimation.},

	Abstract = {This study evaluated the critical period hypothesis for second language (L2) acquisition. The participants were 240 native speakers of Korean who differed according to age of arrival (AOA) in the United States (1 to 23 years), but were all experienced in English (mean length of residence ? 15 years). The native Korean participants' pronunciation of English was evaluated by having listeners rate their sentences for overall degree of foreign accent; knowledge of English morphosyntax was evaluated using a 144-item grammaticality judgment test. As AOA increased, the foreign accents grew stronger, and the grammaticality judgment test scores decreased steadily. However, unlike the case for the foreign accent ratings, the effect of AOA on the grammaticality judgment test scores became nonsignificant when variables confounded with AOA were controlled. This suggested that the observed decrease in morphosyntax scores was not the result of passing a maturationally defined critical period. Additional analyses showed that the score for sentences testing knowledge of rule based, generalizable aspects of English morphosyntax varied as a function of how much education the Korean participants had received in the United States. The scores for sentences testing lexically based aspects of English morphosyntax, on the other hand, depended on how much the Koreans used English.},

All papers are framed in Slobin's (1987) {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Thinking for Speaking{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} theory, and aim to test whether the conceptualisation patterns that were learned in early childhood can be relearned or restructured in L2 acquisition. In many papers the focus is on identifying constraints on this restructuring process. Among these constraints, the role of typological differences between languages is investigated in great depth. The studies involve different types of learners, language combinations and tasks. As all informants were given verbal rather than non-verbal tasks, the focus is here on the effects of conceptual transfer from one language on another, and not on the effects of language on non-linguistic cognition. The paper also sketches different avenues for further research in this field and proposes that researchers working in this field might want to take up the challenge of investigating whether speakers of different languages perceive motion outside explicitly verbal contexts differently, as this will enable us to gain an understanding of linguistic relativity effects in this domain. Studying which teaching methods can help learners to restructure their conceptualisation patterns may also shed new light on the aspects of discourse organization and motion event construal that are most difficult for learners. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {This paper presents Bayesian non-parametric models that simultaneously learn to segment words from phoneme strings and learn the referents of some of those words, and shows that there is a synergistic interaction in the acquisition of these two kinds of linguistic information. The models themselves are novel kinds of Adaptor Grammars that are an extension of an embedding of topic models into PCFGs. These models simultaneously segment phoneme sequences into words and learn the relationship between non-linguistic objects to the words that refer to them. We show (i) that modelling inter-word dependencies not only improves the accuracy of the word segmentation but also of word-object relationships, and (ii) that a model that simultaneously learns word-object relationships and word segmentation segments more accurately than one that just learns word segmentation on its own. We argue that these results support an interactive view of language acquisition that can take advantage of synergies such as these.},

	Abstract = {Previous research shows that people can use the co-occurrence of words and objects in ambiguous situations (i.e., containing multiple words and objects) to learn word meanings during a brief passive training period (Yu {\&} Smith, 2007). However, learners in the world are not completely passive but can affect how their environment is structured by moving their heads, eyes, and even objects. These actions can indicate attention to a language teacher, who may then be more likely to name the attended objects. Using a novel active learning paradigm in which learners choose which four objects they would like to see named on each successive trial, this study asks whether active learning is superior to passive learning in a cross-situational word learning context. Finding that learners perform better in active learning, we investigate the strategies and discover that most learners use immediate repetition to disambiguate pairings. Unexpectedly, we find that learners who repeat only one pair per trial--an easy way to infer this pair-perform worse than those who repeat multiple pairs per trial. Using a working memory extension to an associative model of word learning with uncertainty and familiarity biases, we investigate individual differences that correlate with these assorted strategies.},

@article{Kirby2015,
	Abstract = {Language exhibits striking systematic structure. Words are composed of combinations of reusable sounds, and those words in turn are combined to form complex sentences. These properties make language unique among natural communication systems and enable our species to convey an open-ended set of messages. We provide a cultural evolutionary account of the origins of this structure. We show, using simulations of rational learners and laboratory experiments, that structure arises from a trade-off between pressures for compressibility (imposed during learning) and expressivity (imposed during communication). We further demonstrate that the relative strength of these two pressures can be varied in different social contexts, leading to novel predictions about the emergence of structured behaviour in the wild.},
	Annote = {language learning by na{\"{i}}ve individuals introduces a pressure for simplicity arising from a domain-independent bias for compressibility in learning, and a pressure for expressivity arises from lan- guage use in communication. Crucially, both must be in play: neither pressure alone leads reliably to structure. The structural design features of language are a solution to the problem of being compressible and expressive, a solution delivered by the process of cultural evolution.

pressures for learnabiility alone result in degenerate langs

"Cultural evolution responds to a pressure for language to be expressive, driven by the fact that it is used for commu- nication, and a pressure for language to be compressible, driven by the fact that it needs to be learned in order to be transmitted over multiple generations. Linguistic structure is the result."},

Hannula and Lehtinen (Learn Instr 15:237--256, 2005) have shown that children's tendency to spontaneously focus on numerosity (SFON) predicts the development of natural number and arithmetic skills. The present study follows 36 children from the age of 6 years to the age of 12 years in order to determine how preschool SFON tendency and number sequence skills are related to rational number conceptual knowledge at the age of 12 years. The results show that children's SFON tendency before school age is a strong predictor of later rational numbers conceptual knowledge, even after controlling for preschool number sequence skills. This finding has implications for the understanding of how the transition from reasoning about natural number concepts to reasoning about rational numbers may be influenced by children's self-initiated practice with numbers in everyday situations.},

Although these findings have often been used to support the implementation of educational programs based on direct instruction, we argue that guided play approaches can be equally effective at delivering content and are more developmentally appropriate in their focus on child-centered exploration. Guided play lies midway between direct instruction and free play, presenting a learning goal, and scaffolding the environment while allowing children to maintain a large degree of control over their learning. The evidence suggests that such approaches often outperform direct-instruction approaches in encouraging a variety of positive academic outcomes. We argue that guided play approaches are effective because they create learning situations that encourage children to become active and engaged partners in the learning process.},

While infants may initially benefit from attending primarily or solely to infant-directed speech, which contains few grammatical errors, older infants may listen more to adult-directed speech. In a first experiment, Post-verbal infants preferred fluent speech to disfluent speech, while Pre-verbal infants showed no preference. In a second experiment, Post-verbal infants discriminated disfluent and fluent speech even when lexical information was removed, showing that they make use of prosodic properties of the speech stream to detect disfluency. Because disfluencies are highly correlated with grammatical errors, this sensitivity provides infants with a means of filtering ungrammaticality from their input.},

However, little is known about the time course of the behavior matching, even though there is evidence that dyads synchronize oscillatory motions (e.g., postural sway). This study examined the temporal structure of nonoscillatory actions-language, facial, and gestural behaviors-produced during a route communication task. The focus was the temporal relationship between matching behaviors in the interlocutors (e.g., facial behavior in one interlocutor vs. the same facial behavior in the other interlocutor). Cross-recurrence analysis revealed that within each category tested (language, facial, gestural), interlocutors synchronized matching behaviors, at temporal lags short enough to provide imitation of one interlocutor by the other, from one conversational turn to the next. Both social and cognitive variables predicted the degree of temporal organization. These findings suggest that the temporal structure of matching behaviors provides low-level and low-cost resources for human interaction.},

While work with newborns and infants has been broadly consistent with predictions from the model, further refinements and questions have been raised.

Fidelity of phonological encoding was tested in a picture-fixation task using correctly pronounced and mispronounced stimuli. Only children with additional exposure in familiarization showed reduced recognition performance given slight mispronunciations relative to correct pronunciations; children with fewer exposures did not. Mathematical modeling of vocabulary exposure indicated that children may hear thousands of words frequently enough for accurate encoding. The results provide evidence compatible with partial failure of phonological encoding at 19 months of age, demonstrate that this limitation in learning does not always hinder word recognition, and show the value of infants' word-form encoding in early lexical development.},

	Abstract = {The importance of emergent literacy skills as a foundation for proficient reading has led to the development of interventions to teach these skills. These interventions are particularly important for children from disadvantaged homes because they often lack the home literacy experiences necessary for building foundational literacy skills prior to school entry. While previous interventions have been successful in developing literacy skills, noticeably absent has been instruction to develop comprehension. In this study, teachers explicitly taught the narrative structure to kindergarten and first grade children in high poverty schools to increase their comprehension of children's literature. Instruction was delivered as children listened to stories during daily story time. The findings indicate that children who learned story structures recalled more ideas from new stories and answered more questions about structural elements of those stories (e.g., who is the main character?). The results suggest that teachers can deliver effective comprehension instruction to emergent and beginning readers in the context of listening comprehension activities. ¬{\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

This is clearly not the case. We argue that conversation is easy because of an interactive processing mechanism that leads to the alignment of linguistic representations between partners. Interactive alignment occurs via automatic alignment channels that are functionally similar to the automatic links between perception and behaviour (the so-called perception-behaviour expressway) proposed in recent accounts of social interaction. We conclude that humans are 'designed' for dialogue rather than monologue.},

	Abstract = {Speakers often tailor their utterances to the needs of particular addressees - a process called audience design. We argue that important aspects of audience design can be understood as emergent features of ordinary memory processes. This perspective contrasts with earlier views that presume special processes or representations. To support our account, we present a study in which Directors engaged in a referential communication task with two independent Matchers. Over several rounds, the Directors instructed the Matchers how to arrange a set of picture cards. For half the triads, the Directors' card categories were initially distributed orthogonally by Matcher (e.g. Directors described birds and dogs with one Matcher and fish and frogs with the other). For the other triads, the Directors' card categories initially overlapped across Matchers (e.g. Directors described two members of each category with each Matcher). We predicted that the orthogonal configuration would more readily allow Directors to encode associations between particular cards and particular Matchers - and thus allow those Directors to provide more evidence for audience design. Content analyses of Directors' utterances from two final rounds supported our prediction. We suggest that audience design depends on the memory representations to which speakers have ready access given the time constraints of routine conversation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Byers-Heinlein2013,
	Abstract = {In ambiguous word learning situations, infants can use systematic strategies to determine the referent of a novel word. One such heuristic is disambiguation. By age 16-18months, monolinguals infer that a novel noun refers to a novel object rather than a familiar one (Halberda, 2003), while at the same age bilinguals and trilinguals do not reliably show disambiguation (Byers-Heinlein {\&} Werker, 2009; Houston-Price, Caloghiris, {\&} Raviglione, 2010). It has been hypothesized that these results reflect a unique aspect of the bilingual lexicon: bilinguals often know many translation equivalents, cross-language synonyms such as English dog and Mandarin g{\v o}u. We studied the role of vocabulary knowledge in the development of disambiguation by relating 17-18month-old English-Chinese bilingual infants' performance on a disambiguation task to the percentage of translation equivalents in their comprehension vocabularies. Those bilingual infants who understood translation equivalents for more than half the words in their vocabularies did not show disambiguation, while infants who knew a smaller proportion of translation equivalents showed disambiguation just as same-aged monolinguals do. These results demonstrate that the structure of the developing lexicon plays a key role in infants' use of disambiguation.},

In some circumstances monolingual children even express the belief that an individual's language is more stable than her race. The present research investigated bilingual children's thinking about the relative stability of language and race (Kinzler {\&} Dautel, 2012). Five-to six-year-old bilingual children were asked to judge whether a target child who varied in race (White or Black) and language (English or French) would grow up to be an adult who maintained the target child's race or her language. Similar to many monolin-gual children, a heterogeneous group of bilingual children on average chose the language-match. Yet French-English bilingual children were relatively more likely to choose the race-match, espe-cially when tested in their non-dominant language. Specific experience with relevant languages, and communicating in a non-dominant language, may contribute to children's developing metalin-guistic success and their thinking about social categorization.},

One way that explaining inconsistency may promote discovery is by guiding exploratory, hypothesis-testing behavior. In order to investigate this, a study with young children ranging in age from 2 to 6 years (N = 80) examined the relation between explanation and exploratory behavior following consistent versus inconsistent outcomes.

	Abstract = {Two hundred forty English-speaking toddlers (24- and 36-month-olds) heard novel adjectives applied to familiar objects (Experiment 1) and novel objects (Experiment 2). Children were successful in mapping adjectives to target properties only when information provided by the noun, in conjunction with participants' knowledge of the objects, provided coherent category information: when basic-level nouns or superordinate-level nouns were used with familiar objects, when novel basic-level nouns were used with novel objects, and--for 36-month-olds--when the nouns were underspecified with respect to category (thing or one) but participants could nonetheless infer a category from pragmatic and conceptual knowledge. These results provide evidence concerning how nouns influence adjective learning, and they support the notion that toddlers consider pragmatic factors when learning new words.},

	Abstract = {English language learners (ELLs) who experience slow vocabulary development are less able to comprehend text at grade level than their English-only peers. Such students are likely to perform poorly on assessments in these areas and are at risk of being diagnosed as learning disabled. In this article, we review the research on methods to develop the vocabulary knowledge of ELLs and present lessons learned from the research concerning effective instructional practices for ELLs. The review suggests that several strategies are especially valuable for ELLs, including taking advantage of students' first language if the language shares cognates with English; ensuring that ELLs know the meaning of basic words, and providing sufficient review and reinforcement. Finally, we discuss challenges in designing effective vocabulary instruction for ELLs. Important issues are determining which words to teach, taking into account the large deficits in second-language vocabulary of ELLs, and working with the limited time that is typically available for direct instruction in vocabulary. This article highlights the need for sustained attention to the vocabulary development of English language learners (ELLs), reviews the research on means to develop the vocab-ulary knowledge of ELLs, presents lessons learned from the research, and describes several important issues that should be considered in the development of practices to build vo-cabulary knowledge in this group of students. Past models of reading considered vocabulary knowledge an important source of variation in reading comprehension, particularly as it affects higher-level language processes such as grammatical processing, construction of schemata, and text models (Adams {\&} Collins, 1977; Chall, 1987). Skilled readers can tolerate a small proportion of unknown words in a text without disruption of comprehension and can even infer the meanings of those words from sufficiently rich contexts. However, if the proportion of unknown words is too high, comprehension is disrupted (Carver, 1994). More recently, vocabulary has taken a more central role in models of read-ing as research uncovers its influence on earlier reading and reading-related skills including phonological, orthographic, and morphosyntactic processes (},

	Abstract = {Much recent research has shown that children are sensitive to basic principles of fair distribution of resources much earlier than previously assumed. Under appropriate circumstances, toddlers and sometimes even infants both expect that others will follow principles of equal distribution of resources and do so themselves. But from these findings it remains unclear whether young children understand and follow such principles of fairness as normative rules. The current study tested for such an understanding of the normative force of principles of resource distribution with a novel method. In the study, 3- and 5-year-olds witnessed how a (puppet) agent distributed resources jointly earned by herself and a fellow agent in equal or unequal ways. In one condition, the child herself or himself was this fellow agent, and in another condition it was an unrelated third party. Children spontaneously protested frequently against unfair distributions both when they themselves were affected and when another third party was affected (and never did so after fair distributions), with 5-year-olds doing so in more explicitly normative terms than 3-year-olds. These findings suggest that young children indeed understand principles of fair distribution as normatively binding regardless of whether they are personally affected or not.},

In two eye-tracking experiments, the authors investigated the expectations underlying the effect of precedents on comprehension. The authors show that listeners expect speakers to be consistent in their use of expressions even when these expectations cannot be motivated by the assumption of cooperativeness. The authors conclude that though this phenomenon seems to be motivated by cooperativeness, listeners' expectation that speakers be consistent in their use of expressions is governed by a general expectation of consistency.},

Unfortunately, the published literature offers little explicit guidance on these issues, forcing investigators to base their decisions on informal rules of thumb, idiosyncratic training experiences, or personal communications. With these needs in mind, we intend this chapter to be a guide for investigators contemplating the use of short film clips to elicit emotion. We first outline the general task of eliciting emotion in a laboratory. Second, we compare the properties of films to other laboratory emotion induction procedures. Third, we discuss how to use films in different experimental contexts and avoid potential pitfalls. Fourth, we offer examples of films that have worked well in our own research applications. Finally, we close with reflections on the future evolution of films as an emotion elicitation procedure.},

Twenty-two (46{\%}) of the 48 identified patients had full-thickness injuries that were treated surgically. Medical costs associated with treadmill friction injuries averaged US 2,385 dollars. The number of treadmill friction accidents resulting in friction injuries to children less than 6 years of age deserves serious attention and increased public awareness.},

	Abstract = {In three studies, we explored what the flexible use of a word like hammer, to label an object (``She bought a hammer'') and a functional use of that object (``She hammered the nail''), reveal about the structure of word meanings and the locus of creativity in language. We tested the idea that such uses of words are supported by complex, generative structures that specify the meaning of a noun (e.g., a hammer) and its corresponding verb (e.g., to hammer). In support of this idea, we showed that 4- and 5-year-olds spontaneously expect a novel label for an action to also label the instrument involved in that action, in the absence of any evidence that it can. To show this, we taught children a novel word for an action (e.g., that dax labeled hammering a nail). We then presented children with pictures of the instrument (e.g., a hammer) and patient of the event (e.g., a nail), and asked them to indicate the referent of a second word (e.g., ``Show me the kiv!''). Children systematically chose the patient, suggesting that they expected that the first word, which had labeled the action, would also label the instrument, blocking the second word from labeling it. Children displayed this tendency both when the first novel word had a familiar meaning, and when it had an entirely novel meaning. Together, our studies suggest that the noun and verb forms of words like hammer do not correspond to unrelated lexical items, but are instead related by generative structures that allow children to anticipate the flexibility of new words.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a spreading-activation theory of human semantic pro- cessing, which can be applied to a wide range of recent experimental re- sults. The theory is based on Quillian's theory of semantic memory search and semantic preparation, or priming. In conjunction with this, several of the miscondeptions concerning Qullian's theory are discussed. A number of additional assumptions are proposed for his theory in order to apply it to recent experiments. The present paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production experiments by Loftus, Juola and Atkinson's multiple-category experiment, Conrad's sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by Holyoak and Glass, Rips, Shoben, and Smith, and Rosch. The paper also provides a critique of the Smith, Shoben, and Rips model for categorization judgments.},

@article{Slevc2009,
	Abstract = {Linguistic processing, especially syntactic processing, is often considered a hallmark of human cognition; thus, the domain specificity or domain generality of syntactic processing has attracted considerable debate. The present experiments address this issue by simultaneously manipulating syntactic processing demands in language and music. Participants performed self-paced reading of garden path sentences, in which structurally unexpected words cause temporary syntactic processing difficulty. A musical chord accompanied each sentence segment, with the resulting sequence forming a coherent chord progression. When structurally unexpected words were paired with harmonically unexpected chords, participants showed substantially enhanced garden path effects. No such interaction was observed when the critical words violated semantic expectancy or when the critical chords violated timbral expectancy. These results support a prediction of the shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis (Patel, 2003), which suggests that music and language draw on a common pool of limited processing resources for integrating incoming elements into syntactic structures.

	Abstract = {Properties of the input, such as raw frequency and syntactic diversity, have been shown to play a role, to different extents, in the acquisition of nouns and verbs. This study investigated the relationship between three properties of the input (input frequency, syntactic diversity, and variety in noun-type co-occurrence) and age of acquisition of English adjectives. In addition, this study explored the relationship between adjectival semantic typology and order of acquisition. The data are 7262 child utterances and 6318 maternal utterances containing one of 272 adjective in the language samples of two children, Sarah and Adam, from age 2;3 to 5;0 (Brown, 1973) available in CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000). Statistical analyses revealed that all three properties of the input were significantly correlated with age of acquisition, but variety in noun-type co-occurrence was not a significant predictor once input frequency and syntactic diversity were taken into account. Semantic analyses revealed that the distribution of adjective types and tokens differed between the children and the mothers (to an extent) when the data were examined in terms of adjectival semantic types. The results suggest that both properties of the input and the semantic properties of the English adjective class play a role in its acquisition.},

@article{Begus2012,
	Abstract = {In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in the motivations behind, and the function of, infant pointing behaviour. Many studies have converged on the view that early pointing reflects a motivation to share attention and interest with others. Under one view, it is the sharing of attention itself that is the ultimate function of pointing, and is an early manifestation of a uniquely human social cognition that is geared towards cooperation and collaboration. In the current study, we tested an alternative hypothesis in which the goal of pointing is not attention sharing itself, but the information-laden response that infants tend to receive as a result of sharing attention. If infants indeed point in order to obtain information, their pointing should be modulated by the perceived ability of the other to provide this information. In Experiment 1, 16-month-olds who interacted with a demonstrably knowledgeable experimenter pointed significantly more to novel objects than infants who interacted with an ignorant experimenter. In Experiment 2, we confirmed that this finding was due to the perceived competence of the experimenter rather than to the different ways in which the experimenter responded to infants' points. Our results suggest that one function of pointing in infancy is to obtain information from others, and that infants selectively elicit desired information from those whom they perceive could competently provide it.},

We highlight some relevant back- ground on the Language Gap and describe some of the research used to support the concept. The diverse slate of Forum contributions that we have assembled approach the Language Gap topic from a range of linguistic anthropological perspectives---theoretical, empirical, political, eth- nographic, personal, and experiential. Based on an acknowledgment of the need to improve educational access for economically and culturally diverse students, the subsequent discussions provide a range of perspectives designed to move away from denouncing and altering home language skills as a panacea for academic woes and social inequity. Linguistic anthropology's focus on language learning ecologies, and the sophistication therein, provides a novel perspec- tive on the Language Gap. The contributions included below problematize existing ideologies, demonstrate the wealth of resources within various communities, and propose new directions for school practices and policymaking in an effort to bridge the ``language gap'' toward a more inclusive and discerning view of linguistic practices across diverse groups.

	Abstract = {Two studies examined social determinants of adolescents' math anxiety including parents' own math anxiety and children's endorsement of math-gender stereotypes. In Study 1, parent-child dyads were surveyed and the interaction between parent and child math anxiety was examined, with an eye to same- and other-gender dyads. Results indicate that parent's math anxiety interacts with daughters' and sons' anxiety to predict math self-efficacy, GPA, behavioral intentions, math attitudes, and math devaluing. Parents with lower math anxiety showed a positive relationship to children's math outcomes when children also had lower anxiety. The strongest relationships were found with same-gender dyads, particularly Mother-Daughter dyads. Study 2 showed that endorsement of math-gender stereotypes predicts math anxiety (and not vice versa) for performance beliefs and outcomes (self-efficacy and GPA). Further, math anxiety fully mediated the relationship between gender stereotypes and math self-efficacy for girls and boys, and for boys with GPA. These findings address gaps in the literature on the role of parents' math anxiety in the effects of children's math anxiety and math anxiety as a mechanism affecting performance. Results have implications for interventions on parents' math anxiety and dispelling gender stereotypes in math classrooms.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cognitive Science Society, Inc. Previous accounts of how people develop expertise have focused on how deliberate practice transforms the cognitive and perceptual representations and processes that give rise to expertise. However, the likelihood of developing expertise with a particular tool may also depend on the degree to which that tool fits pre-existing perceptual and cognitive abilities. The present studies explored whether the abacus-a descendent of the first human computing devices-may have evolved to exploit general biases in human visual attention, or whether developing expertise with the abacus requires learning special strategies for allocating visual attention to the abacus. To address this question, we administered a series of visual search tasks to abacus experts and subjects who had little to no abacus experience, in which search targets and distractors were overlaid atop abacus "beads." Across three studies, we found that both experts and na{\"{i}}ve subjects were faster to detect targets in semantically relevant components of the abacus, suggesting that abacus training is not required to exhibit attentional biases toward these components of the abacus. This finding suggests that the attentional biases that scaffold numerical processing of the abacus may emerge from general properties of visual attention that are exploited by the design of the abacus itself.},

@article{Lupyan2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Languages differ greatly both in their syntactic and morphological systems and in the social environments in which they exist. We challenge the view that language grammars are unrelated to social environments in which they are learned and used. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a statistical analysis of {\textgreater}2,000 languages using a combination of demographic sources and the World Atlas of Language Structures--a database of structural language properties. We found strong relationships between linguistic factors related to morphological complexity, and demographic/socio-historical factors such as the number of language users, geographic spread, and degree of language contact. The analyses suggest that languages spoken by large groups have simpler inflectional morphology than languages spoken by smaller groups as measured on a variety of factors such as case systems and complexity of conjugations. Additionally, languages spoken by large groups are much more likely to use lexical strategies in place of inflectional morphology to encode evidentiality, negation, aspect, and possession. Our findings indicate that just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. As adults learn a language, features that are difficult for them to acquire, are less likely to be passed on to subsequent learners. Languages used for communication in large groups that include adult learners appear to have been subjected to such selection. Conversely, the morphological complexity common to languages used in small groups increases redundancy which may facilitate language learning by infants. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We hypothesize that language structures are subjected to different evolutionary pressures in different social environments. Just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. The proposed Linguistic Niche Hypothesis has implications for answering the broad question of why languages differ in the way they do and makes empirical predictions regarding language acquisition capacities of children versus adults.},

This study reports SES-related differences both in the quantity and quality of mathematical support children receive in the home and in parent beliefs about early mathematical development and then compares both with children's performance on a comprehensive mathematics assessment. Participants included 90 children in their 1st year of preschool (2 years before kindergarten entry) and 88 children in their prekindergarten year (the year just prior to kindergarten entry). Both cohorts were balanced for SES and gender. The results suggested minimal SES-related variation in mathematical support received in either cohort but clear SES differences in parents' beliefs about early mathematical development. Middle SES parents of children in both cohorts held higher expectations in terms of skills they expected children to possess by age 5, as well as a more accurate understanding of which skills are within the developmental range of most children by age 5. These differences accounted for unique variance in children's scores on the mathematics assessment. Practice or Policy: Implications are discussed.

Gradually, such systems have either been abandoned or more intensively exploited, with a subsequent decrease in species numbers. Until recently, it was thought that restoration of these communities would be straightforward. However, abiotic constraints (with respect to eutrophication and acidification) have hampered restoration more than previously thought. Moreover, very recent research has revealed that biotic constraints can also be important: many plant species are not present in the soil seed bank and their dispersal is limited in the present fragmented landscape.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has shown that children who heard a novel object described, in passing, as "the one that my uncle gave me" were equally good at remembering which object the fact referred to. This present reply concerns S. R. Waxman and A. E. Booth's article (see record 2000-16221-004) which found that children extended the word to novel objects from the same category, but did not show this pattern of extension for the new fact. The authors find this result unsurprising, and they agree with Waxman and Booth that words and facts are different. Furthermore, the extension patterns of novel words can be determined in part on the basis of grammatical form, while the extension patterns of facts often depend on the precise nature of the facts in question. Determining the extension of a word is different from determining the extension of a fact. The authors believe that the human language capacity depends on which aspect of language one is concerned with. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2003 APA )},

@article{Scontras2017,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of the English noun amount, a word that ostensibly relies on measurement in its semantics, yet stands apart from other quantiz-ing nouns on the basis of its existential interpretation. John ate the amount of apples that Bill ate does not mean John and Bill ate the same apples, but rather that they each ate apples in the same quantity. Amount makes reference to abstract representations of measurement, that is, to degrees. Its existential interpretation evidences the fact that degrees contain information about the objects that instantiate them. Outside the domain of nominal measurement, the noun kind exhibits behavior strikingly similar to that of amount; both yield an existential interpretation. This observation moti-vates re-conceiving of degrees as nominalized quantity-uniform properties---the same sort of entity as kinds. Thus, the semantic machinery handling kinds also handles degrees: as nominalized properties, degrees are instantiated by objects that hold the corresponding property; when instantiated by real-world objects, degrees (and kinds) deliver the existential interpretation.},

@article{Newport2001,
	Abstract = {(From the chapter) Over many years J. Mehler has provided us all with a wealth of surprising and complex results on both nature and nurture in language acquisition. He has shown that there are powerful and enduring effects of early (and even prenatal) experience on infant language perception. In his honor, we focus here on one of the problems he has addressed--the notion of a critical period for language acquisition--and attempt to sort out the current state of the evidence. Two issues are implicit in this discussion: First, what would constitute evidence for a critical period, particularly in humans, where the time scale for development is greater than that in the well-studied nonhuman cases, and where proficient behavioral outcomes might be achieved by more than one route? Second, what is the import of establishing, or failing to establish, such a critical period? What does this mean for our understanding of the computational and neural mechanisms underlying language acquisition? This chapter addresses these issues explicitly, by briefly reviewing the available evidence on a critical period for human language acquisition, and then by asking whether the evidence meets the expected criteria for critical or sensitive periods seen in other well-studied domains in human and nonhuman development.

@article{Futrell2015,
	Abstract = {In communicating events by gesture, participants create codes that recapitulate the patterns of word order in the world's vocal languages (Gibson et al., 2013; Goldin-Meadow, So, Ozyurek, {\&} Mylander, 2008; Hall, Mayberry, {\&} Ferreria, 2013; Hall, Ferreira, {\&} Mayberry, 2014; Langus {\&} Nespor, 2010; and others). Participants most often convey simple transitive events using gestures in the order Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), the most common word order in human languages. When there is a possibility of confusion between subject and object, participants use the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). This overall pattern has been explained by positing an underlying cognitive preference for subject-initial, verb-final orders, with the verb-medial order SVO order emerging to facilitate robust communication in a noisy channel (Gibson et al., 2013). However, whether the subject-initial and verb-final biases are innate or the result of languages that the participants already know has been unclear, because participants in previous studies all spoke either SVO or SOV languages, which could induce a subject-initial, verb-late bias. Furthermore, the exact manner in which known languages influence gestural orders has been unclear. In this paper we demonstrate that there is a subject-initial and verb-final gesturing bias cross-linguistically by comparing gestures of speakers of SVO languages English and Russian to those of speakers of VSO languages Irish and Tagalog. The findings show that subject-initial and verb-final order emerges even in speakers of verb-initial languages, and that interference from these languages takes the form of occasionally gesturing in VSO order, without an additional bias toward other orders. The results provides further support for the idea that improvised gesture is a window into the pressures shaping language formation, independently of the languages that participants already know.},

Two classrooms in a preschool center using a science inquiry curriculum were videotaped during a 5-week unit on color mixing. Videotapes were analyzed for how teachers facilitated children's explanatory language. An assessment of explanatory language was administered to 47 children in the center before and after the color mixing unit. Analysis of discourse revealed that teachers engaged children as conversational partners and as scientific investigators responsible for their own learning. Explanations were dynamically co-constructed by adults and children within the context of participation in scientific inquiry. By the end of the unit, children produced more on-topic responses, more standard color-mixing terms, and more causal connectives in their responses to the assessment of explanatory language. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, depressed and nondepressed participants viewed standardized neutral, sad, fear, and amusing films; and experiential, behavioral, and physiological responses to each film were assessed. Compared with nondepressed controls, depressed participants reported sadness and amusement in a flattened, context-insensitive manner. Those depressed participants who reported the least reactivity to the sad film exhibited the greatest concurrent impairment. Prospectively, the depressed participant who exhibited the least behavioral and heart rate reactivity to the amusing film were the least likely to recover from depression. Loss of the context-appropriate modulation of emotion in depression may reflect a core feature of emotion dysregulation in this disorder.},

	Abstract = {The hypothesis was tested that children whose families differ in socioeconomic status (SES) differ in their rates of productive vocabulary development because they have different language-learning experiences. Naturalistic interaction between 33 high-SES and 30 mid-SES mothers and their 2-year-old children was recorded at 2 time points 10 weeks apart. Transcripts of these interactions provided the basis for estimating the growth in children's productive vocabularies between the first and second visits and properties of maternal speech at the first visit. The high-SES children grew more than the mid-SES children in the size of their productive vocabularies. Properties of maternal speech that differed as a function of SES fully accounted for this difference. Implications of these findings for mechanisms of environmental influence on child development are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This study aims to establish at what age children learn to integrate these two sources of information in the interpretation process and tests comprehension of the Dutch adjectives groot 'big' and klein 'small' by 2- to 7-year-old children. The results demonstrate that there is a gradual increase in the ability to inhibit visual cues and to use world knowledge for interpreting size terms. 2- and 3-year-old children only used the extremes of the perceptual range as reference points. From age four onwards children, like adults, used a cut-off point in the mid-zone of a series. From age five on, children were able to integrate world knowledge and perceptual context. Although 7-year-olds could make subtle distinctions between sizes of various object classes, their performance on incongruent items was not yet adult-like.},

	Abstract = {Speakers tend to prepare their nouns immediately before saying them, rather than preparing them further in advance. To test the limits of this last-second preparation, speakers were asked to name object pairs without pausing between names. There was not enough time to prepare the second name while articulating the first, so the speakers' delay in starting to say the first name was based on the amount of time available to prepare the second name during speech. Before speaking, they spent more time preparing a second name (e.g., carrot) when the first name was monosyllabic (e.g., wig) rather than multisyllabic (e.g., windmill). When additional words intervened between names, the length of the first name became less important and speech began earlier. Preparation differences were reflected in speech latencies, durations, and eye movements. The results suggest that speakers are sensitive to the length of prepared words and the time needed for preparing subsequent words. They can use this information to increase fluency while minimizing word buffering.},

	Abstract = {Grice (Syntax and semantics: Speech acts, 1975, pp. 41-58, Vol. 3) proposed that conversation is guided by a spirit of cooperation that involves adherence to several conversational maxims. Three types of maxims were explored in the current study: 1) Quality, to be truthful; 2) Relation, to say only what is relevant to a conversation; and 3) Quantity, to provide as much information as required. Three- to five-year-olds were tested to determine the age at which an awareness of these Gricean maxims emerges. Children requested the help of one of two puppets in finding a hidden sticker. One puppet always adhered to the maxim being tested, while the other always violated it. Consistently choosing the puppet that adhered to the maxim was considered indicative of an understanding of that maxim. The results indicate that children were initially only successful in the Relation condition. While in general, children performed better at first in the Quantity condition compared with the Quality condition, 3-year-olds never performed above chance in the Quantity condition. The findings of the present study indicate that preschool children are sensitive to the violation of the Relation, Quality, and Quantity maxims at least under some conditions.},

A more efficient scheme would be to represent categories as locations in a continuous semantic space mapped smoothly across the cortical surface. To search for such a space, we used fMRI to measure human brain activity evoked by natural movies. We then used voxelwise models to examine the cortical representation of 1,705 object and action categories. The first few dimensions of the underlying semantic space were recovered from the fit models by principal components analysis. Projection of the recovered semantic space onto cortical flat maps shows that semantic selectivity is organized into smooth gradients that cover much of visual and nonvisual cortex. Furthermore, both the recovered semantic space and the cortical organization of the space are shared across different individuals.},

	Abstract = {Following research that found imitation in single-word shadowing, this study examines the degree to which interacting talkers increase similarity in phonetic repertoire during conversational interaction. Between-talker repetitions of the same lexical items produced in a conversational task were examined for phonetic convergence by asking a separate set of listeners to detect similarity in pronunciation across items in a perceptual task. In general, a listener judged a repeated item spoken by one talker in the task to be more similar to a sample production spoken by the talker's partner than corresponding pre-and postinteraction utterances. Both the role of a participant in the task and the sex of the pair of talkers affected the degree of convergence. These results suggest that talkers in conversational settings are susceptible to phonetic convergence, which can mark nonlinguistic functions in social discourse and can form the basis for phenomena such as accent change and dialect formation.},
	Annote = {Men and women might sustain habitual attentional sets that vary across different circumstances, leading to differences in the
grain of perceptual analysis and subsequent shadowing or conversational convergence.
- not automatic priming because social setting influenced it
- These findings do not support an interpretation based solely on differences in perceptual sen- sitivity; rather, functions outside the domain of perception appear to be influencing the degree of phonetic convergence. Although perceptual sensitivity to indexical or phonetic
features is necessary for accommodation, it is not sufficient to evoke phonetic convergence. Attention may adjust the grain of perceptual resolution, but additional processes influ- ence a talker's phonetic form. The current study cannot provide a clear explanation for the direction of the observed effects of talker sex and role, but the reliability of these effects challenges an account of convergence based solely on a direct link between speech perception and speech production. If automatic priming is the mechanism by which pho- netic convergence operates, then the sex-and role-governed patterns found here must be due to processes within speech perception and/or production that are susceptible to extralin- guistic factors. There is currently no account of priming that incorporates the sex or role of a talker as a modulator of the degree of priming

The current study found evidence for a form of delayed imitation: Phonetic convergence in conversational settings persisted into a post-task session. An episodic memory sys- tem containing detailed lexical episodes could not form the basis for this effect because the delay would increase the influence of long-term memory traces on repeated words, leading to reduced phonetic convergence. Moreover, the ob- served increase in phonetic convergence over the course of conversational interaction occurred across different lexical items, providing evidence that the change in phonetic reper- toire was not tied to specific lexical forms. 
- Communication is more than a matching process; a talker expresses more than a sequence of phonemes, and a listener uses the speech signal to understand the talker as well as the message. If some part of phonetic variability is communicative, i.e., it serves some purpose for the talker, then a listener who resolves the phonetic detail can project this into a perception of the talker's connotation, apart from lexical access. Among interacting talkers, phonetic convergence might contribute to mutual comprehension and/or rapport through a decrease in social distance (Shepard, Giles, and LePoire, 2001)

Although these findings extend convergence in conversational interaction to the phonetic domain, interacting talkers do not match on all acoustic-phonetic dimensions. If per- ception yields goals that drive production, then an adequate account of this relation requires an explanation of the lack of perfect correspondence. Because some of the disparities between talkers in this study patterned according to talker role and sex, it is likely that the discrepancy is due to more than noisy perceptual resolution or productive output of gestural goals. Individual talkers in social settings have communicative goals that go beyond mere intelligibility, and these goals must be an integral part of the perceptual and productive system that creates the spoken message. Perhaps such goals act as weights on embedded forcing functions that incorporate perceived phonetic structures into produced phonetic forms.},

	Abstract = {Children generally behave more egocentrically than adults when assessing another's perspective. We argue that this difference does not, however, indicate that adults process information less egocentrically than children, but rather that adults are better able to subsequently correct an initial egocentric interpretation. An experiment tracking participants' eye movements during a referential communication task indicated that children and adults were equally quick to interpret a spoken instruction egocentrically but differed in the speed with which they corrected that interpretation and looked at the intended (i.e., non-egocentric) object. The existing differences in egocentrism between children and adults therefore seems less a product of where people start in their perspective taking process than where they stop, with lingering egocentric biases among adults produced by insufficient correction of an automatic moment of egocentrism. We suggest that this pattern of similarity in automatic, but not controlled, processes may explain between-group differences in a variety of dual-process judgments. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Preterm infants are at increased risk of language-related problems later in life; however, few studies have examined the effects of preterm birth on cerebral responses to speech at very early developmental stages. This study examined cerebral activation and functional connectivity in response to infant-directed speech (IDS) and adult-directed speech (ADS) in full-term neonates and preterm infants at term-equivalent age using 94-channel near-infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that compared with ADS, IDS increased activity in larger brain areas such as the bilateral frontotemporal, temporal, and temporoparietal regions, both in full-term and preterm infants. Preterm infants exhibited decreased activity in response to speech stimuli in the right temporal region compared with full-term infants, although the significance was low. Moreover, preterm infants exhibited increased interhemispheric connectivity compared with full-term controls, especially in the temporal and temporoparietal regions. These differences suggest that preterm infants may follow different developmental trajectories from those born at term owing to differences in intrauterine and extrauterine development.},

@article{Goodman2015,
	Abstract = {Commentary Computational models in psychology are precise, fully explicit scientific hypotheses. Probabilistic models in par-ticular formalize hypotheses about the beliefs of agents--- their knowledge and assumptions about the world---using the structured collection of probabilities referred to as priors and likelihoods. The probability calculus then describes inferences that can be drawn by combining these beliefs with new evidence, without the need to commit to a process-level explanation of how these infer-ences are performed (Marr, 1982). Over the past 15 years, probabilistic modeling of human cognition has yielded quantitative theories of a wide variety of phenomena (Tenenbaum, Kemp, Griffiths, {\&} Goodman, 2011). Marcus and Davis (2013) critiqued several examples of this work on the basis of the existence of alternative models and potentially inconsistent data, using these cri-tiques to question the basic validity of the probabilistic-models approach. Contra the broad rhetoric of their article, however, the points made by Marcus and Davis--- although useful to consider---do not indicate systematic problems with the probabilistic-modeling enterprise. Several of Marcus and Davis's objections stem from a fundamental confusion about the status of optimality in probabilistic modeling, which has been discussed in responses to other critiques (see Frank, 2013; Griffiths, Chater, Norris, {\&} Pouget, 2012). Briefly, an optimal analy-sis is not the optimal analysis for a task or domain. Different probabilistic models instantiate different psy-chological hypotheses. Optimality provides a bridging assumption between these hypotheses and human behavior---one that can be reexamined or overturned as the data warrant. Model Selection Marcus and Davis argued that individual probabilistic models require a host of potentially problematic modeling choices. Indeed, probabilistic models are created via a series of choices concerning, among other things, priors, likelihoods, and response functions. Each of these choices embodies a proposal about cognition, and these proposals will often be wrong. Identifying model assump-tions that result in a mismatch to empirical data allows these assumptions to be replaced or refined. Systematic iteration to achieve a better model is part of the normal progress of science. But if choices are made post hoc, a model can be overfit to the particulars of the empirical data. Marcus and Davis suggested that certain of our models suffer from this problem. For instance, they showed that data on pragmatic inference (Frank {\&} Goodman, 2012) are inconsistent with an alternative vari-ant of the proposed model that uses a hard-max rather than a soft-max function, and they asked whether our choice of a soft-max rule was dependent on the data. The soft-max rule is foundational in economics, deci-sion theory, and cognitive psychology (Luce, 1959, 1977), and we first selected it for this problem on the basis of a completely independent set of experiments (Frank, Goodman, Lai, {\&} Tenenbaum, 2009). It is therefore hard to see how a claim of overfitting is warranted. Modelers must balance unification with exploration of model assumptions across tasks, but this issue is a general one for all computational work and does not constitute a sys-tematic problem with the probabilistic approach.},

Nouns + Frames Condition: This condition combined the two types of linguistic context, noun co-occurrence (Nouns Condition) and syntactic frame information (Frames Condition), simply by putting the nouns and pronouns words back into the nonsense frames. Note that this manipulation converts co- occurrence information to selectional information.

These are the relatively concrete verbs that describe specific actions in and on the observable world (fall, stand, turn, play, wait, hammer, push, throw, pop),

@article{Ameel2008,
	Abstract = {Despite arguments for the relative ease of learning common noun meanings, semantic development continues well past the early years of language acquisition even for names of concrete objects. We studied evolution of the use of common nouns during later lexical development. Children aged 5-14 years and adults named common household objects and their naming patterns were compared. Children showed a gradual convergence to the adult categories through addition of new words to the vocabulary as well as extended reorganizations of existing categories. Different theories of early lexical development make competing proposals about the differences in featural knowledge that result in discrepancies from adult word use. To evaluate these theories with respect to later lexical development, we used features collected from adults and children to predict the naming patterns of the different age groups. Consistent with [Mervis, C. B. (1987). Child-basic object categories and early lexical development. In U. Neisser (Ed.), Concepts and conceptual development: ecological and intellectual factors in categorisation (pp. 201-233). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press], children gradually learned to attend to the adult feature sets and to assign the features the appropriate weights. A sorting task showed that, furthermore, evolution of general conceptual knowledge as well as word-specific knowledge contributes to the convergence. We discuss implications for developing a theory of later lexical development. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Seventy-six children ages 3 to 5 were individually read two storybooks that had been specially formatted to contain salient printed words within the text, and illustrations and text on left or right-facing pages. The reader pointed to each word while reading to half of the children. After each book, children were asked to recognize elements of the illustrations and the specially formatted text elements from among a set of foils. Videotaped sessions were coded for the time children spent looking toward the pages with print versus illustrations. Analyses showed that the percentage of time looking at print was less than 2{\%} in the no-pointing condition but increased with age. Pointing to the words increased print-looking time for all age groups and print target recognition for 4-year-olds. After controlling for receptive vocabulary, visual memory, and maturation associated with these scores, emergent orthography and letter-word identification predicted time looking at print and recognition of the print elements.},

	Abstract = {A large field study of children in first and second grade explored how parents' anxiety about math relates to their children's math achievement. The goal of the study was to better understand why some students perform worse in math than others. We tested whether parents' math anxiety predicts their children's math achievement across the school year. We found that when parents are more math anxious, their children learn significantly less math over the school year and have more math anxiety by the school year's end---but only if math-anxious parents report providing frequent help with math homework. Notably, when parents reported helping with math homework less often, children's math achievement and attitudes were not related to parents' math anxiety. Parents' math anxiety did not predict children's reading achievement, which suggests that the effects of parents' math anxiety are specific to children's math achievement. These findings provide evidence of a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of low math achievement and high math anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

@article{Tolins2016,
	Abstract = {Observing others in conversation is a common format for comprehending language, yet little work has been done to understand dialog comprehension. We tested whether overhearers use addressee backchannels as predictive cues for how to integrate information across speaker turns during comprehension of spontaneously produced collaborative narration. In Experiment 1, words that followed specific backchannels (e.g., really, oh) were recognized more slowly than words that followed either generic backchannels (e.g., uh huh, mhm) or pauses. In Experiment 2, we found that when the turn after the backchannel was a continuation of the narrative, specific backchannels prompted the fastest verification of prior information. When the turn after was an elaboration, they prompted the slowest, indicating that overhearers took specific backchannels as cues to integrate preceding talk with subsequent talk. These findings demonstrate that overhearers capitalize on the predictive relationship between backchannels and the development of speakers' talk, coordinating information across conversational roles.

Experiment 2 (N= 48 18-month-olds and 48 24-month-olds) and Experiment 3 (N= 48 24-month-olds) varied short-term familiarity with the model (some or none) and learning context (interactive or observational). The most striking findings were that toddlers were able to learn a new action from observing completely unfamiliar strangers who did not address them and were far less likely to imitate an unfamiliar model who directly interacted with them. These studies highlight the robustness of toddlers' observational learning and reveal limitations of learning from unfamiliar models in interactive contexts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Humor was related to competence in several ways consistent with previous theory and research: (1) through the manifestation of intellectual ability both in humor behaviors and in competent functioning; (2) through the role of mastery motivation enhancing both types of functioning; and (3) through peer relations, resulting from the effects of humor on peer acceptance or the effects of peer relations on humor behaviors.

	Abstract = {A series of experiments explore the effects of attention-directing cues on pronoun resolution, contrasting four specific hypotheses about the interpretation of ambiguous pronouns he and she: (1) it is driven by grammatical rules, (2) it is primarily a function of social processing of the speaker's intention to communicate, (3) it is modulated by the listener's own egocentric attention, and (4) it is primarily a function of learned probabilistic cues. Experiment 1 demonstrates that pronoun interpretation is guided by the well-known N1 (first-mention) bias, which is also modulated by both the speaker's gaze and pointing gestures. Experiment 2 demonstrates that a low-level visual capture cue has no effect on pronoun interpretation, in contrast with the social cue of pointing. Experiment 3 uses a novel intentional cue: the same attention-capture flash as in Experiment 2, but with instructions that the cue is intentionally created by the speaker. This cue does modulate the N1 bias, demonstrating the importance of information about the speaker's intentions to pronoun resolution. Taken in sum, these findings demonstrate that pronoun resolution is a process best categorized as driven by an appreciation of the speaker's communicative intent, which may be subserved by a sensitivity to predictive cues in the environment. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The purpose of this study was to explore when children know that compound nouns refer to two objects, one ideally interacting with the other (e.g., "fish shoes" are shoes with fish on them, not next to them). Thirty-five English-speaking three- and four-year-old children participated in this study. They were given both a production and comprehension task with novel compound nouns. The results showed that the three-year-olds and the four-year-olds were equally likely to produce compounds to name two interacting objects. However, the three-year-olds were less likely than the four-year-olds to understand that a compound referred necessarily to two objects. These results demonstrate that children's knowledge of the meaning of compound nouns is still developing in the preschool years. Three possible interpretations of the mismatch in comprehension and production are discussed: (1). there are modality differences in processing by children, (2). the meaning tapped by production and comprehension is not identical, and (3). the tasks differed in complexity.},

	Abstract = {Adults typically use an exaggerated, distinctive speaking style when addressing infants. However, the effects of infant-directed (ID) speech on infants' learning is not yet well understood. This research investigates how ID speech affects how infants perform a key function in language acquisition, associating the sounds of words with their meanings. Seventeen-month-old infants were presented with two label-object pairs in a habituation-based word learning task. In Experiment 1, the labels were produced in adult-directed (AD) speech. In Experiment 2, the labels were produced in ID prosody; they had higher pitch, greater pitch variation, and longer durations than the AD labels. We found that infants failed to learn the labels in AD speech, but succeeded in learning the same labels when they were produced in ID speech. Experiment 3 investigated the role of variability in learning from ID speech. When the labels were presented in ID prosody with no variation across tokens, infants failed to learn them. Our findings indicate that ID prosody can affect how readily infants map sounds to meanings and that the variability in prosody that is characteristic of ID speech may play a key role in its effect on learning new words.},

	Abstract = {The ability to design unconfounded experiments and make valid inferences from their outcomes is an essential skill in scientific reasoning. The present study addressed an important issue in scientific reasoning and cognitive development: how children acquire a domain-general processing strategy (Control of Variables Strategy or CVS) and generalize it across various contexts. Seven- to 10-year-olds (N = 87) designed and evaluated experiments and made inferences from the experimental outcomes. When provided with explicit training within domains, combined with probe questions, children were able to learn and transfer the basic strategy for designing unconfounded experiments. Providing probes without direct instruction, however, did not improve children's ability to design unconfounded experiments and make valid inferences. Direct instruction on CVS not only improved the use of CVS, but also facilitated conceptual change in the domain because the application of CVS led to unconfounded, informative tests of domain-specific concepts. With age, children increasingly improved their ability to transfer learned strategies to remote situations. A trial-by-trial assessment of children's strategy use also allowed the examination of the source, rate, path, and breadth of strategy change.},

	Abstract = {Frequent or contextually predictable words are often phonetically reduced, i.e. shortened and produced with articulatory undershoot. Explanations for phonetic reduction of predictable forms tend to take one of two approaches: Intelligibility-based accounts hold that talkers maximize intelligibility of words that might otherwise be difficult to recognize; production-based accounts hold that variation reflects the speed of lexical access and retrieval in the language production system. Here we examine phonetic variation as a function of phonological neighborhood density, capitalizing on the fact that words from dense phonological neighborhoods tend to be relatively difficult to recognize, yet easy to produce. We show that words with many phonological neighbors tend to be phonetically reduced (shortened in duration and produced with more centralized vowels) in connected speech, when other predictors of phonetic variation are brought under statistical control. We argue that our findings are consistent with the predictions of production-based accounts of pronunciation variation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

But how are such theories shaped by the culture in which children are raised? We addressed this question by exploring how Indian children's attitudes toward the Hindu caste system -- and its deterministic worldview -- were related to differences in their intuitive theories. Strikingly, we found that beginning in middle school and continuing into adulthood, individuals who placed more importance on caste were more likely to adopt deterministic intuitive theories. This effect was far-reaching, such that attitudes toward caste were related not only to beliefs about the ability of members of different castes, but also to beliefs about the malleability of personal intelligence and personality attributes, and even to broader stances regarding personal freedom. These results are the first to directly relate the societal structure in which children are raised to the individual intuitive theories they adopt.},

	Abstract = {How do children infer the meanings of their first words? Even in infant-directed speech, object nouns are often used in complex contexts with many possible referents and in sentences with many other words. Previous work has argued that children can learn word meanings via cross-situational observation of correlations between words their referents. While cross-situational associations can sometimes be informative, social cues about what a speaker is talking about can provide a powerful shortcut to word meaning. The current study takes steps towards quantifying the informativeness of cues that signal speakers' chosen referent, including their eye-gaze, the position of their hands, and the referents of their previous utterances. We present results based on a hand-annotated corpus of 24 videos of child-caregiver play sessions with children from 6 to 18 months old, which we make available to researchers interested in similar issues. Our analyses suggest that although they can be more useful than cross-situational information in some contexts, social and discourse information must also be combined probabilistically to be effective in determining reference.},

	Abstract = {The present study attempted to investigate whether young learners who were new to knowledge building approaches could work towards advancing both individual and collective knowledge, and whether knowledge building could be beneficial to both high-achieving and low-achieving students. Findings reported in this paper are from one and a half-year design research for science learning in one primary school in Singapore. In this study, we closely examined the design and enactment of the Knowledge Building Community model in one class with high-achieving students and two classes with mixed-ability students. The research consists of two phases: Phase I Cultivating a collaborative knowledge building culture and Phase II Progressive Knowledge Building using Knowledge Forum. Data were collected from multiple sources, including knowledge assessment, conceptual understanding tasks, and the content analysis of Knowledge Forum postings. The results in Phase I show that while it is critical for students to monitor and build knowledge for their own understanding, they had difficulties developing such skills. In both phases, we found positive impacts on academic achievements showing improvement of student understanding in the course of reflective thinking and progressive inquiry. Overall, quantitative data suggest that the collaborative knowledge building environment was beneficial for both high-achieving and low-achieving students. We conclude by discussing some of challenges and issues in designing collaborative knowledge building environments for young learners with diverse abilities. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Early-acquired words are processed faster than late-acquired words. This is a well-accepted effect within the word recognition literature. Different explanations have been proposed, either localizing the effect of age of acquisition (AoA) in a particular substage of word processing or seeing it as the result of the way in which information is stored and accessed in the brain in general. The cumulative-frequency hypothesis is an example of the latter type of explanation: It states that the total number of times a system has come across a particular stimulus will determine the speed with which the stimulus can be recognized. The present multi-task investigation provides a critical test of the different explanations. Results show that in a variety of word processing tasks the effects of frequency and AoA are highly correlated, and that the impact of AoA is consistently higher than would be expected on the basis of the cumulative-frequency hypothesis. The findings are interpreted as evidence for recent demonstrations of a loss of plasticity in neural networks due to training and/or for mathematical models that describe the growth of the lexico-semantic network as the attachment of new nodes to existing nodes. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {The rapidity with which children acquire language is one of the mysteries of human cognition. A view held widely for the past 30 years is that children master language by means of a language-specific learning device. An earlier proposal, which has generated renewed interest, is that children make use of domain-general, associative learning mechanisms. However, our current lack of knowledge of the actual learning mechanisms involved during infancy makes it difficult to determine the relative contributions of innate and acquired knowledge. A recent approach to studying this problem exposes infants to artificial languages and assesses the resulting learning. In this article, we review studies using this paradigm that have led to a number of exciting discoveries regarding the learning mechanisms available during infancy. These studies raise important issues with respect to whether such mechanisms are general or specific to language, the extent to which they reflect statistical learning versus symbol manipulation, and the extent to which such mechanisms change with development. The fine-grained characterizations of infant learning mechanisms that this approach permits should result in a better understanding of the relative contributions of, and the dynamic between, innate and learned factors in language acquisition.},

It presents and defends a contextualist semantics for these predicates, derived from current work on gradable adjectives.

It argues they are not metasemantically different from those in other gradable adjectives, and that contextual parameters of this sort are widespread in natural language. Furthermore, this paper shows that if such parameters are rejected, it leads to an unacceptably rampant form of relativism, that relativizes truth to an open-ended list of parameters.},

Specifically, given situations in which groups of agents have epistemic states that bear on a modal domain, how is the domain best restricted? This is a metasemantic project, in which I combine a standard semantics for epistemic modals, as developed by Kratzer, with a standard story about conversational dynamics, as developed by Stalnaker. I show how a standard framework for epistemic logic can model their interaction. I contend that if groups have epistemic states that bear on the modal domain, as the data suggests, then careful attention must be paid to the method of combination selected for the epistemic states of the individuals within the group. Specifically, there should be some explanation of the flow of information in a group-deliberative setting. Through this study we find a novel explanation of modal disagreement and uptake},

This new, fully updated and revised The New Handbook of Language and Social Psychology reflects the increasingly diverse range of linguistic topics that social psychologists have investigated over the decade since the previous edition of this seminal work was published. Whilst the basic organization of the text remains the same, explanatory frameworks are accorded greater prominence than before and persons are seen as agents of communicative interaction rather than as victims of external of forces. Processes and actions are highlighted, i.e. how people do what they do and how they manage the discourse. In the final section, several applied topics reflect our changing lifestyle: computer-mediated communication, mass media, and organizations. The New Handbook of Language and Social Psychology is an essential source book for all psychologists concerned with language and how it functions in human communication. Those interested in interpersonal and intergroup social relations will find much relevance, as will practitioners and other professionals working in health and welfare, multilingual contexts, and organizations.},

	Abstract = {Research on implicit person theories shows that people who believe that human attributes are immutable ("entity theorists") are particularly prone to endorse social stereotypes and to explain them with reference to innate factors. We argue that entity theories belong to a broader set of beliefs that represent differences between people in terms of underlying essences. New measures of three essentialist beliefs (i.e., in the biological basis, discreteness, and informativeness of human attributes) were developed in a pilot study. In the main study, these beliefs were found to covary with entity theories, and to predict the endorsement and innate explanation of stereotypes. Essentialist beliefs predicted stereotype endorsement independently of popular stereotyping-related individual difference measures, and in a way that was not reducible to the effect of entity theories. We propose that research on implicit person theories can be placed within an encompassing framework of psychological essentialism. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Dominey2004,
	Abstract = {Language acquisition represents one of the great learning achievements in human cognitive development. Perhaps, this process takes place in a relatively automatic manner in which, simply through exposure to language input, the child configures her language organ to coincide with the structure of the maternal language. In this context, the problem of the vast uncertainty between speech input and its external referent, related to the more general notion of the 'poverty of the stimulus' problem, takes on a significant importance, and motivates the nativist suggestion that language is already essentially preprogrammed, and acquisition consists of setting the parameters for the target language based on limited exposure.What if, however, the acquisition process was not so automatic, but rather was controlled by the operation of mechanisms that could direct the attention of the child to specific aspects of the sentence and its external referent? In this case, external and internal control of attention could significantly reduce the referential uncertainty, thus reducing the requirement for preprogrammed language.The current paper outlines evidence for this second scenario, in which child directed speech guides the child's attention to important aspects of the speech signal, and Joint Attention focuses his attention on the relevant aspects of the referential world, significantly reducing the poverty of the stimulus problem. Results from recent simulation studies are briefly reviewed that indicate how these mechanisms could then allow a relatively non-specific learning mechanism to acquire initial knowledge of grammatical constructions in the first steps of language acquisition. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Three experiments (N = 224) found striking differences in preschoolers' inductive generalization and exploration of a novel functional property, depending on whether identical evidence for the property was produced accidentally, intentionally, or pedagogically and communicatively. Results also revealed that although 4-year-olds reserved strong generalizations for a property that is pedagogically demonstrated, 3-year-olds made such inferences when it was produced either intentionally or pedagogically. These findings suggest that by age 4 children assess whether evidence is produced for their benefit in gauging generalizability, giving them a powerful tool for acquiring important kind-relevant, generic knowledge.},

	Abstract = {We report two sets of experiments that demonstrate syntactic priming from comprehension to comprehension in young children. Children acted out double-object and prepositional-object dative sentences while we monitored their eye movements. We measured whether hearing one type of dative as a prime influenced children's online interpretation of subsequent dative utterances. In target sentences, the onset of the direct object noun was consistent with both an animate recipient and an inanimate theme, creating a temporary ambiguity in the argument structure of the verb (double-object e.g., Show the horse the book; prepositional-object e.g., Show the horn to the dog). The first set of experiments demonstrated priming in four-year-old children (M = 4.1), both when the same verb was used in prime and target sentences (Experiment 1a) and when different verbs were used (Experiment 1b). The second set found parallel priming in three-year-old children (M = 3.1). These results indicate that young children employ abstract structural representations during online sentence comprehension. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Traditionally, investigations into this question have used elicited-response tasks in which children are asked a direct question about an agent's false belief. Results from these tasks indicate that the ability to attribute false beliefs does not emerge until about age 4. However, recent investigations using spontaneous-response tasks suggest that this ability is present much earlier. Here we review results from various spontaneous-response tasks that suggest that infants in the second year of life can already attribute false beliefs about location and identity as well as false perceptions. We also consider alternative interpretations that have been offered for these results, and discuss why elicited-response tasks are particularly difficult for young children. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Griffiths2007a,
	Abstract = {Languages are transmitted from person to person and generation to generation via a process of iterated learning: people learn a language from other people who once learned that language themselves. We analyze the consequences of iterated learning for learning algorithms based on the principles of Bayesian inference, assuming that learners compute a posterior distribution over languages by combining a prior (representing their inductive biases) with the evidence provided by linguistic data. We show that when learners sample languages from this posterior distribution, iterated learning converges to a distribution over languages that is determined entirely by the prior. Under these conditions, iterated learning is a form of Gibbs sampling, a widely-used Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The consequences of iterated learning are more complicated when learners choose the language with maximum posterior probability, being affected by both the prior of the learners and the amount of information transmitted between generations. We show that in this case, iterated learning corresponds to another statistical inference algorithm, a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. These results clarify the role of iterated learning in explanations of linguistic universals and provide a formal connection between constraints on language acquisition and the languages that come to be spoken, suggesting that information transmitted via iterated learning will ultimately come to mirror the minds of the learners.},
	Annote = {Advocates of the traditional explanation of linguistic universals in terms of constraints arising from an innate language faculty can seize upon our results for learners who sample from the posterior distribution, which dictate a one-to-one correspondence between the inductive biases of learners and the languages that ultimately manifest in a population. These results provide an important missing piece of the traditional story, indicating how soft constraints on individual learning can influence the languages spoken by a population. If the prior distribution is taken as reflecting innate constraints specific to language learning (a view which we do not encourage, as mentioned in Section 3), then our results show that iterated learning can act as the engine by which these constraints result in universals. Those who prefer the idea that linguistic universals can be produced by iterated learning exaggerating the weak biases expressed in general-purpose learning algorithms can take heart from our results for learners who use MAP estimation, which illustrate that iterated learning can potentially emphasize weak biases. The information bottleneck also provides a further factor that could contribute to this effect. Even though our present results have something to offer for both sides of the debate, they do place some important constraints on possible explanations. In particular, our analysis suggests two questions that we might pursue in order to evaluate the plausibility of different explanations for linguistic universals. The first question is whether human language learners are better approximated as sampling from the posterior distribution or selecting the hypothesis with greater posterior probability. We provided some empirical arguments for the appropriateness of sampling in Section 4, but this is an issue that has not been explored in depth in the case of language learning (although see Hudson-Kam {\&} Newport, 2005). If learners are closer to sampling than maximizing, strong constraints are necessary. If they are closer to maximizing, then the weak biases of general-purpose learning mechanisms might be sufficient. The second question is whether we can identify general-purpose learning algorithms that have inductive biases (albeit weak ones) consistent with the properties of human languages. Our results indicate that only languages favored by the prior will be produced by iterated learning, regardless of whether learners sample or maximize. In previous work, the inductive biases of different algorithms have largely been investigated by running iterated learning simulations (Kirby, 2001; Brighton, 2002; Smith et al., 2003). The connection between biases and universals indicated by our results suggests a more productive mode of analysis might be to investigate these biases directly, determining which kinds of languages are easier to learn with different prospective general-purpose learning algorithms.
---
We have used this framework to provide a detailed account of the consequences of iterated learning with Bayesian learners. The use of Bayesian inference makes it possible to explicitly identify the inductive biases of our learners, and to demonstrate that these biases strongly affect the outcome of iterated learning. Formally establishing the basic predictions that result from iterated learning paves the way towards being able to develop more complete models of language evolution, exploring the interaction between iterated learning and forces of cultural and biological selection. It also provides insight into the plausibility of different explanations of linguistic universals, providing new terms in which to formulate the debate about the relationship between linguistic universals and the inductive biases of learners. Going beyond language evolution, our analysis of iterated learning with Bayesian learners provide conditions under which information transmitted via iterated learning will ultimately come to mirror the structure of the mind of the learners. This information will be influenced by the inductive biases of learners, regardless of the source of those biases and whether the learners sample from the posterior or use MAP estimation. This correspondence suggests that we should look closely at the universal properties of human languages, since, under this account, they should reflect the biases behind human language learning. More generally, our results suggest that any information transmitted by a process of iterated learning---not just languages, but also legends, religious concepts, and social norms---will ultimately come to be tailored to match people's inductive biases, providing a formal justification for treating these phenomena as a source of clues about the assumptions that guide human thought.

We can use Bayes' rule to model language acquisition by assuming that each hypothesis h is a language, and the data d are a set of utterances sampled from the target language.2 The likelihood, P(d|h), indicates the probability of observing a particular set of utterances d if the language h were the target. If we assume that the learners have accurate knowledge of the production algorithm in use, the probability they should associate with d if the target language is h is simply the probability of d under that production algorithm, PP A(d|h). Applying Bayes' rule, we have P(h|d) = PP A(d|h)P(h) PP A(d) (18) where PP A(d) = h∈H PP A(d|h)P(h). (19) The specific values of P(h|d) will be determined by the prior, P(h). The assumption that all learners share the same learning algorithm (made above, to guarantee that our Markov chain is homogeneous) requires that all learners share the same prior. 3.1. Interpreting priors, hypotheses, and data The standard interpretation of the prior, P(h), as representing the extent to which the learner believes in a hypothesis before seeing any data is perhaps not the best way to understand the role that it plays under this view of language acquisition. The prior is better seen as determining the amount of evidence that a learner would need to see in order to adopt a particular language. Thinking of the prior as expressing the amount of evidence a learner would need in order to choose a particular language makes it clear how it can encode the biases of learners: only hypotheses with positive prior probability will enter into consideration, and hypotheses with higher prior probabilities are easier to learn (requiring less evidence, and ultimately less data). Our formal analyses will not make a commitment to the nature of the prior, the hypotheses, or the data. Consequently, they are consistent with many different approaches to modeling language acquisition, from artificial neural network models (Rumelhart {\&} McClelland, 1986), in which the hypotheses are continuous functions represented by the weights of a network (MacKay, 1995; Neal, 1992), to parameter-setting models, in which hypotheses are con- figurations of a small number of discrete parameters (Gibson {\&} Wexler, 1994; Niyogi {\&} Berwick, 1996). The Bayesian framework is not supposed to be interpreted as a statement of the mechanistic process by which language acquisition takes place, with learners maintaining T. L. Griffiths, M. L. Kalish/Cognitive Science 31 (2007) 451 a hypothesis space in their heads and updating a distribution over those hypotheses. Rather, it is a computational level analysis (Marr, 1982), as is generally emphasized in rational models of cognition (Anderson, 1990; Oaksford {\&} Chater, 1998; Chater {\&} Oaksford, 1999), focusing on the abstract computational problem and a method for solving that problem. So long as the actual process underlying language acquisition approximates this solution, our results will have implications for understanding human behavior. Finally, it is important to note that the prior distribution assumed by a learner should not be interpreted as reflecting innate constraints specific to language acquisition. The prior simply collects together all of the factors affecting how easily a learner will come to entertain a particular hypothesis. There are many such factors other than language-specific innate constraints: data from other domains that is independent of the observed linguistic data given a hypothesis about the structure of language, but nonetheless affects the beliefs that the learner entertains about that structure; information-processing constraints, such as limitations on working memory; or the inductive bias associated with some kind of general-purpose learning algorithm. Every learning algorithm assumes some kind of inductive bias, and this bias is essential to the success of the algorithm (Geman, Bienenstock, {\&} Doursat, 1992; Kearns {\&} Vazirani, 1994; Vapnik, 1995).},

Forty interviewers (ERs), undergraduates enrolled in a class on interviewing processes, conducted 20--30 minute interviews with selected interviewees (EEs), business persons and professionals in fields of interest to the ERs. Speech behaviors examined included response latency, speech rate, and turn duration; these were coded per one minute intervals of each interaction. Time series regression procedures indicated that both ERs and EEs converged speech rate and response latency toward their interlocutors' performances of these behaviors. Although turn duration convergence did not characterize the entire data set, male-male dyads did converge significantly and male (ER)-female (EE) dyads significantly diverged turn duration. Regarding speech evaluation, there was some evidence that greater response latency similarity, greater speech rate and response latency convergence, and faster ER speech and slower EE speech were positively related to the competence and social attractiveness judgments of participants.

Design: Thirty-minute semistructured, face-to-face interviews with staff. Setting: Two residential summer camps in northeastern Pennsylvania. Participants: Fifty-two adult ({\textgreater}18 years of age) staff. Phenomenon of Interest: Staff's perceived responsibilities, problems encountered, and feeding practices used during camp mealtimes. Analysis: Qualitative interviews were analyzed using a hybrid analysis approach that combined deductive directed content analysis with inductive thematic analysis to identify themes and subthemes. Results: The majority of staff indicated their responsibility during mealtimes was to ensure that campers eat. Common problems mentioned were campers' tendencies toward picky eating and overeating. Staff reported a number of strategies to deal with common mealtime problems including reasoning, modeling, limits or rules, punishment/contingencies, and responding to campers' needs/preferences. Conclusions and Implications: Most staff expressed concern about promoting campers' healthy eating behaviors. Although staff discussed several mealtime strategies that can be interpreted as adaptive in authoritative contexts, they need more guidance related to what they should and should not do during mealtimes. Avenues for future research to inform the promotion of healthier mealtime behaviors in camps are discussed.},

We accept as self-evident that any explanation of this learning must take nonlinguistic experience as relevant: When children hear words spoken by adults, they also observe objects, scenes, and events. Yet the issues here are quite perplexing because, at least to first inspection, heard words seem to map only very inexactly onto the child's observations of objects, scenes, and events.  In light of such difficulties, we tried to get some insight into how the child constructs the right mappings between words and the world by examining a situation in which the opportunities to observe the world are diminished: the case of langauge learning by congenitally blind children.  There is an evidently unshakable tradition which asserts that the blind must in principle be defective in their learning---of language, of space, and more.  We shall document that these a priori opinions cannot survive confrontation with the reality of language learning in congenitally blind children. Blind learners not only learn the forms of language but their meanings as well; their speech cannot be characterized as replete with "verbalisms" (the clinical term for blind learners' putative use of certain words as "sound without meaning").

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Inc. Deictic time words like ``yesterday'' and ``tomorrow'' pose a challenge to children not only because they are abstract, and label periods in time, but also because their denotations vary according to the time at which they are uttered: Monday's ``tomorrow'' is different than Thursday's. Although children produce these words as early as age 2 or 3, they do not use them in adult-like ways for several subsequent years. Here, we explored whether children have partial but systematic meanings for these words during the long delay before adult-like usage. We asked 3- to 8-year-olds to represent these words on a bidirectional, left-to-right timeline that extended from the past (infancy) to the future (adulthood). This method allowed us to independently probe knowledge of these words' deictic status (e.g., ``yesterday'' is in the past), relative ordering (e.g., ``last week'' was before ``yesterday''), and remoteness from the present (e.g., ``last week'' was about 7 times longer ago than ``yesterday''). We found that adult-like knowledge  of deictic status and order emerge in synchrony, between ages 4 and 6, but that knowledge of remoteness emerges later, after age 7. Our findings suggest that children's early use of deictic time words is not random, but instead reflects the gradual construction of a structured lexical domain.},

	Abstract = {Neuropsychology is one field that holds promise in the construction of comprehensive, developmental models for the promotion of social competence and prevention of problem behavior. Neuropsychological models of behavior suggest that children's neurological functioning affects the regulation of strong emotions, as well as performance in social, cognitive, and behavioral spheres. The current study examines the underlying neurocognitive conceptual theory of action of one social-emotional development program. Hypothesized was that inhibitory control and verbal fluency would mediate the relationship between program condition and teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Participants were 318 regular education students enrolled in the second or third grade. A series of regression analyses provided empirical support for (a) the effectiveness of the PATHS Curriculum in promoting inhibitory control and verbal fluency and (b) a partial mediating role for inhibitory control in the relation between prevention condition and behavioral outcomes. Implications are that programs designed to promote social and emotional development should consider comprehensive models that attend to neurocognitive functioning and development. Lack of consideration of neurocognitive pathways to the promotion of social competence may ignore important mechanisms through which prevention affects youth outcomes. Furthermore, the findings suggest that developers of social-emotional preventions should design curricula to explicitly promote the developmental integration of executive functioning, verbal processing, and emotional awareness. Doing so may enhance prevention outcomes particularly if those preventions are implemented during a time of peak neurocognitive development.},

By manipulating the physical properties of the stimuli, we were able to affect the degree to which candidate variables could be isolated; by manipulating the base rate of candidate causes, we were able to affect the potential for information gain.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE Despite communication skills training in medical school, junior doctors continue to demonstrate poor patient-doctor communication skills, where patient unhappiness from the encounter often manifests as patient complaints. We sought to identify crucial communication skills that should be incorporated in the communications curriculum by learning from patient complaints, to explore how the communication lapses occur. METHOD 38 cases of anonymized negative patient feedback about junior doctors were analysed using qualitative content analysis. A two-step fine-coding system involving four researchers was employed. RESULTS Four main themes of communication errors were identified, namely: non-verbal (eye contact, facial expression and paralanguage), verbal (active listening and inappropriate choice of words), and content (poor quantity and quality of information provided); and poor attitudes (lack of respect and empathy). DISCUSSION Patient-doctor communication is a complex interpersonal interaction that requires an understanding of each party׳s emotional state. We identified important but overlooked communication lapses such as non-verbal paralinguistic elements that should be incorporated into communications curriculum, with an emphasis on dialectical learning. These include integrating these findings into a simulation-based communications module for training doctors at a post-graduate level as well as monitoring and analyzing patient complaints regularly to iteratively update the content of the training module. Beyond these skills training, there is also a need to highlight negative emotions of doctors in future research, as it influences their communication patterns and attitudes towards patients, ultimately shaping how patients perceive them.},

	Abstract = {In three experiments, a referential communication task was used to determine the conditions under which speakers produce and listeners use prosodic cues to distinguish alternative meanings of a syntactically ambiguous phrase. Analyses of the actions and utterances from Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that Speakers chose to produce effective prosodic cues to disambiguation only when the referential scene provided support for both interpretations of the phrase. In Experiment 3, on-line measures of parsing commitments were obtained by recording the Listener's eye movements to objects as the Speaker gave the instructions. Results supported the previous experiments but also showed that the Speaker's prosody affected the Listener's interpretation prior to the onset of the ambiguous phrase, thus demonstrating that prosodic cues not only influence initial parsing but can also be used to predict material which has yet to be spoken. The findings suggest that informative prosodic cues depend upon speakers' knowledge of the situation: speakers provide prosodic cues when needed; listeners use these prosodic cues when present. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The analysis is based on a large corpus (from 80 pairs of speakers) of task-oriented dia- logues elicited using Garrod and Anderson's (1987) cooperative maze game procedure. As in previous work with adult conversants, our analysis con- centrates on how the speakers establish local description ``languages'' or schemes to describe their locations on the maze. The results indicate that there is strong pressure for speakers of all ages to co-ordinate on common description schemes. However, more detailed analysis of the dialogues suggests that there are two underlying principles of co-ordination operating. While the youngest conversants (7- to {\&}year-olds) show evidence of super- ficial oosrdination processes - establishing a limited common dialogue lexicon and particular common description scheme - only the older speak- ers show evidence of deep co-ordination processes aimed at directly estab- lishing the mutual intelligibility of the common scheme},

	Abstract = {[It takes two people working together to play a duet, shake hands, play chess, waltz, teach, or make love. To succeed, the two of them have to coordinate both the content and process of what they are doing. Alan and Barbara, on the piano, must come to play the same Mozart duet. This is coordination of content. They must also synchronize their entrances and exits, coordinate how loudly to play forte and pianissimo, and otherwise adjust to each other's tempo and dynamics. This is coordination of process. They cannot even begin to coordinate on content without assuming a vast amount of shared information or common ground---that is, mutual knowledge, mutual beliefs, and mutual assumptions (Clark {\&} Carlson, 1982; Clark {\&} Marshall, 1981; Lewis, 1969; Schelling, 1960). And to coordinate on process, they need to update their common ground moment by moment. All collective actions are built on common ground and its accumulation.]},
	Annote = {Grounding is process by which common ground is updated. Asking a question requires more than uttering an interrogative sentence. It must also be established that the respondent has understood what the questioner meant. Grounding criterion: contributor and her partners mutually believe that the partners have understood what the contributor meant to a criterion sufficient for current purposes, so grounding the collective processby which the participants try to reach that belief. 

Contributing to conversation occurs in two phases (and is not complete before both of them):
- Presentation phase: A presents utterance for B to consider, on the assumption that, if B gives evidence (e) or stronger, he can believe that she understands what he means by u. 
- Acceptance phase: B accepts utterance u by giving evidence e that she believes she understands what A means by u. She does so on the assumption that, once A registers the evidence, he will also believe she understands.

People seek positive evidence of understanding. Three most common forms: acknowledgments (back-channel responses, uh huh, yeah$\backslash$ldotsassessments: gosh, really, good God$\backslash$ldots gestures: nods --- all generally produced without speaker taking turn to talk), relevant next turn (e.g., answer to question, response to request, acceptance of invitation --- initiates next contribution without a break), continued attention (positive evidence of understanding comes with attention that is unbroken or undisturbed. 

Least Collaborative Effort
Traditionally least effort has been exhorted of speaker, e.g. Grice's Quantity and Manner, where speakers are supposed to create proper utterances to be readily and fully understood by addressees$\backslash$$\backslash$
But!
1.) Time pressure: speakers limit time and effort allow for planning and producing, leading to improper utterances: self-repairs (speakers don't take time and effort they need)
2.) Errors: often issue improper utterances because make errors and have to repair (why didn't take time to avoid dysfluencies?)$\backslash$$\backslash$ 
3.) Ignorance: realize don't know enough about interlocutor to design a proper utterance, so forced to issue an improper one instead. 

The principle of least collaborative effort: In conversation, the participants try to minimize their collaborative effort---the work that both do from the initiation of each contribution to its mutual acceptance.

Leads to speakers' preference to repair their own utterances, and initiate their own repairs; presentation of provisional utterance with a try marker, to enlist addressee's help. 

Grounding changes with purpose:
Grounding References
- purpose to establish a referential identity: mutual belief that the addressees have correctly idenitified a referent. 
Common techniques:
- Alternative descriptions (partner can demonstrate have identified referent by presenting an alternative description)$\backslash$$\backslash$
- Indicative gestures (e.g., pointing)$\backslash$$\backslash$
- Referential installments (e.g., using left-dislocation: the small blue cap we talked about before? Yeah. Put that$\backslash$ldots)$\backslash$$\backslash$
- Trial references (present reference with try marker, get partners to confirm or correct before completing presentation)

Grounding Verbatim Content (different goal)
Different specialized grounding techniques (verbatim displays, installments, spelling$\backslash$ldots)

Grounding also changes with medium
What takes effort changes with medium, and media vary on many dimension that affect it (e.g., copresence, visibility, audibility, cotemporality, simultaneity, sequentiality, reviewability, revisability)

Costs of Grounding (vary with medium)
Paid by Speaker$\backslash$$\backslash$
Formulation costs (costs time and effort to formulate and reformulate utterances, more to plan complicated than simple utterances, more to retrieve uncommon than common words$\backslash$ldots)$\backslash$$\backslash$
Production costs (act of producing talks effort)$\backslash$$\backslash$
Paid by Addressee$\backslash$$\backslash$
Reception costs (e.g., listening versus reading)
Understanding costs (more costly to understnd some words, constructions, concepts than others, regardless of medium)$\backslash$$\backslash$
Paid by Both$\backslash$$\backslash$
Start-up costs (cost of starting up a new discourse, getting B to notice that A has uttered something, and to accept that he or she has been addressed).$\backslash$$\backslash$
Delay costs (costs of delaying an utterance in order to plan, recise, and execute more carefully)$\backslash$$\backslash$
Asynchrony costs (timing of acknowledgments, interruptions)$\backslash$$\backslash$

	Abstract = {oung children engage in essentialist reasoning about natural kinds, believing that many traits are innately determined. This study investigated whether personal experience with second language acquisition could alter children's essentialist biases. In a switched-at-birth paradigm, 5- and 6-year-old monolingual and simultaneous bilingual children expected that a baby's native language, an animal's vocalizations, and an animal's physical traits would match those of a birth rather than of an adoptive parent. We predicted that sequential bilingual children, who had been exposed to a new language after age 3, would show greater understanding that languages are learned. Surprisingly, sequential bilinguals showed reduced essentialist beliefs about all traits: they were significantly more likely than other children to believe that human language, animal vocalizations, and animal physical traits would be learned through experience rather than innately endowed. These findings suggest that bilingualism in the preschool years can profoundly change children's essentialist biases.},

	Abstract = {Human social coordination is oſten mediated by language. Through verbal dialogue, people direct each other's attention to properties of their shared environment, they discuss how to jointly solve problems, share their introspections, and distribute roles and assignments. In this article, we propose a dynamical framework for the study of the coordinative role of language. Based on a review of a number of recent experimental studies, we argue that shared symbolic patterns emerge and stabilize through a process of local reciprocal linguistic alignment. Such patterns in turn come to facilitate and refine social coordination by enabling the alignment, joint construction and navigation of conceptual models and actions. Implications of the framework are illustrated and discussed in relation to a case study where dyads of interlocutors interact verbally to reach joint decisions in a perceptual discrimination task.},

	Abstract = {Advances in a wide range of biological, behavioral, and social sciences are expanding our understanding of how early environmental influences (the ecology) and genetic predispositions (the biologic program) affect learning capacities, adaptive behaviors, lifelong physical and mental health, and adult productivity. A supporting technical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) presents an integrated ecobiodevelopmental framework to assist in translating these dramatic advances in developmental science into improved health across the life span. Pediatricians are now armed with new information about the adverse effects of toxic stress on brain development, as well as a deeper understanding of the early life origins of many adult diseases. As trusted authorities in child health and development, pediatric providers must now complement the early identification of developmental concerns with a greater focus on those interventions and community investments that reduce external threats to healthy brain growth. To this end, AAP endorses a developing leadership role for the entire pediatric community-one that mobilizes the scientific expertise of both basic and clinical researchers, the family-centered care of the pediatric medical home, and the public influence of AAP and its state chapters-to catalyze fundamental change in early childhood policy and services. AAP is committed to leveraging science to inform the development of innovative strategies to reduce the precipitants of toxic stress in young children and to mitigate their negative effects on the course of development and health across the life span.},

@article{Messenger2015,
	Abstract = {Children recruit verb syntax to guide verb interpretation. We asked whether 22-month-olds spontaneously encode information about a particular novel verb's syntactic properties through listening to sentences, retain this information in long-term memory over a filled delay, and retrieve it to guide interpretation upon hearing the same novel verb again. Children watched dialogues in which interlocutors discussed unseen events using a novel verb in transitive (e.g., ``Anna blicked the baby'') or intransitive sentences (``Anna blicked``). Children later heard the verb in isolation (``Find blicking!'') while viewing a two-participant causal action and a one-participant action event. Children who had heard transitive dialogues looked longer at the two-participant event than did those who heard intransitive dialogues. This effect disappeared if children heard a different novel verb at test (``Find kradding!''). These findings implicate a role for distributional learning in early verb learning: Syntactic-combinatorial information about otherwise unknown words may pervade the toddler's lexicon, guiding later word interpretation. },

	Abstract = {Infants can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar grammatical patterns expressed in a vocabulary that is distinct from that used earlier during familiarization (Cognition 70(2) (1999) 109; Science 283 (1999) 77). Various models have captured the data, although each required that discrimination be distinct, in terms of the computational process, from familiarization. This article describes a simple recurrent network (SRN), equipped only with the assumption that it should predict what comes next, which models the data without distinguishing between familiarization and discrimination. To accomplish this, the SRN requires pre-training on a range of sequences instantiating different structures and different vocabulary items to those used subsequently during familiarization and test. Pre-training enables the network to avoid replacing structure acquired during familiarization with structure experienced at test. An equivalent enabling condition may underpin infants' resistance to catastrophic interference between the different structures and vocabulary items to which they are exposed.

	Abstract = {Does speaking a language without number words change the way speakers of that language perceive exact quantities? The Pirah?? are an Amazonian tribe who have been previously studied for their limited numerical system [Gordon, P. (2004). Numerical cognition without words: Evidence from Amazonia. Science 306, 496-499]. We show that the Pirah?? have no linguistic method whatsoever for expressing exact quantity, not even "one." Despite this lack, when retested on the matching tasks used by Gordon, Pirah?? speakers were able to perform exact matches with large numbers of objects perfectly but, as previously reported, they were inaccurate on matching tasks involving memory. These results suggest that language for exact number is a cultural invention rather than a linguistic universal, and that number words do not change our underlying representations of number but instead are a cognitive technology for keeping track of the cardinality of large sets across time, space, and changes in modality. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Research Findings: Big Math for Little Kids (BMLK) is a mathematics curriculum developed for use with 4- and 5-year-old children. To investigate the BMLK curriculum's effect on children's mathematics knowledge, this cluster-randomized controlled trial randomly assigned child care centers to provide mathematics instruction to children, using either the BMLK mathematics curriculum or the centers' business-as-usual curriculum, over a 2-year period when children were in prekindergarten and kindergarten. Participants in the study were 762 children and their teachers at 16 publicly subsidized child care centers. The study assessed children's mathematics knowledge using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), Direct Mathematics Assessment, a measure of young children's mathematics knowledge that is not aligned with the curriculum. The ECLS-B scores of children in the BMLK group increased significantly more than did those of children in the comparison group. The study also included exploratory analyses to examine whether children in the BMLK group demonstrated evidence of improved mathematical language. Practice or Policy: These results indicate that the BMLK curriculum, which is designed to help teachers use play-based, developmentally appropriate mathematics instruction, has a positive impact on young children's mathematics knowledge as measured by a general mathematics assessment that is not aligned with the curriculum.

	Abstract = {The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine whether fluid reasoning (FR) plays a significant role in the acquisition of mathematics skills above and beyond the effects of other cognitive and numerical abilities. Using a longitudinal cohort sequential design, we examined how FR measured at three assessment occasions, spaced approximately 1.5 years apart, predicted math outcomes for a group of 69 participants between ages 6 and 21 years across all three assessment occasions. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the direct and indirect relations between children's previous cognitive abilities and their future math achievement. A model including age, FR, vocabulary, and spatial skills accounted for 90{\%} of the variance in future math achievement. In this model, FR was the only significant predictor of future math achievement; age, vocabulary, and spatial skills were not significant predictors. Thus, FR was the only predictor of future math achievement across a wide age range that spanned primary school and secondary school. These findings build on Cattell's conceptualization of FR as a scaffold for learning, showing that this domain-general ability supports the acquisition of rudimentary math skills as well as the ability to solve more complex mathematical problems.},

	Abstract = {Model uncertainty is pervasive in social science. A key question is how robust empirical results are to sensible changes in model specification. We present a new approach and applied statistical software for computational multimodel analysis. Our approach proceeds in two steps: First, we estimate the modeling distribution of estimates across all combinations of possible controls as well as specified functional form issues, variable definitions, standard error calculations, and estimation commands. This allows analysts to present their core, preferred estimate in the context of a distribution of plausible estimates. Second, we develop a model influence analysis showing how each model ingredient affects the coefficient of interest. This shows which model assumptions, if any, are critical to obtaining an empirical result. We demonstrate the architecture and interpretation of multimodel analysis using data on the union wage premium, gender dynamics inmortgage lending, and tax flightmigration among U.S. states. These illustrate how initial results can be strongly robust to alternative model specifications or remarkably dependent on a knife-edge specification.},

	Abstract = {Adaptation by natural selection is a core mechanism of evolution. It is also one of the most widely misunderstood scientific processes. Misconceptions are rooted in cognitive biases found in preschoolers, yet concerns about complexity mean that adaptation by natural selection is generally not comprehensively taught until adolescence. This is long after untutored theoretical misunderstandings are likely to have become entrenched. In a novel approach, we explored 5- to 8-year-olds' capacities to learn a basic but theoretically coherent mechanistic explanation of adaptation through a custom storybook intervention. Experiment 1 showed that children understood the population-based logic of natural selection and also generalized it. Furthermore, learning endured 3 months later. Experiment 2 replicated these results and showed that children understood and applied an even more nuanced mechanistic causal explanation. The findings demonstrate that, contrary to conventional educational wisdom, basic natural selection is teachable in early childhood. Theory-driven interventions using picture storybooks with rich explanatory structure are beneficial.},

	Abstract = {Although structural priming has been considered to be an independent cognitive process, recent evidence suggests that structural priming is modulated by sociocognitive factors such as social perception; speakers are more likely to mimic the sentence structure of a socially desirable interlocutor than the structure of a less desirable interlocutor. This study aims to further address the role of sociocognitive factors in language use by investigating how individual differences in social perception and tendency to align with others (i.e., social monitoring) modulate same-verb structural priming. In particular, we investigate how likely students are to repeat a sentence structure of a teacher depending on their perception of the teacher and their social monitoring tendency. Our results demonstrate that students' tendency to imitate a sentence structure of the teacher is positively influenced by their perception of the teacher but negatively by social monitoring. We suggest that the effects may be accounted for in terms of their influence on attention and memory encoding.},

	Abstract = {The present experiments investigate how young language learners begin to acquire form-based categories and the relationships between them. We investigated this question by exposing 12-month-olds to auditory structure of the form aX and bY (infants had to learn that a-elements grouped with Xs and not Ys). Infants were then tested on strings from their training language versus strings from the other language using a preferential-listening procedure. Importantly, the X and Y elements were new at test, requiring infants to generalize to novel pairings. We also manipulated the probability of encountering grammatical structures of the training language by mixing strings from two artificial languages according to 83/17 and 67/33 percentage ratios in Experiment 2. Experiment 1 shows that 12-month-olds are capable of forming categories of X- and Y-elements based on a shared feature and, furthermore, form associations between particular a- and b-elements and these categories. Experiment 2 shows that learning was sustained even when 17{\%} of instances from another language were present during training. However, infants failed to generalize when exposed to a larger percentage of strings from another language. The findings demonstrate that the first step of form-based category abstraction (the ability to generalize based on marker-feature pairings) is in place by 12 months of age.},

@article{Novack2015,
	Abstract = {iconic gestures are harder to interpret than incomplete-actions.*Children do not view gestures as meaningless movement.*For novice learners, imitating gesture may promote learning. Iconic gesture is a rich source of information for conveying ideas to learners. However, in order to learn from iconic gesture, a learner must be able to interpret its iconic form-a nontrivial task for young children. Our study explores how young children interpret iconic gesture and whether they can use it to infer a previously unknown action. In Study 1, 2- and 3-year-old children were shown iconic gestures that illustrated how to operate a novel toy to achieve a target action. Children in both age groups successfully figured out the target action more often after seeing an iconic gesture demonstration than after seeing no demonstration. However, the 2-year-olds (but not the 3-year-olds) figured out fewer target actions after seeing an iconic gesture demonstration than after seeing a demonstration of an incomplete-action and, in this sense, were not yet experts at interpreting gesture. Nevertheless, both age groups seemed to understand that gesture could convey information that can be used to guide their own actions, and that gesture is thus not movement for its own sake. That is, the children in both groups produced the action displayed in gesture on the object itself, rather than producing the action in the air (in other words, they rarely imitated the experimenter's gesture as it was performed). Study 2 compared 2-year-olds' performance following iconic vs. point gesture demonstrations. Iconic gestures led children to discover more target actions than point gestures, suggesting that iconic gesture does more than just focus a learner's attention, it conveys substantive information about how to solve the problem, information that is accessible to children as young as 2. The ability to learn from iconic gesture is thus in place by toddlerhood and, although still fragile, allows children to process gesture, not as meaningless movement, but as an intentional communicative representation.},

@article{Howard2014,
	Abstract = {Infants' direct interactions with caregivers have been shown to powerfully influence social and cognitive development. In contrast, little is known about the cognitive influence of social contexts beyond the infant's immediate interactions with others, for example, the communities in which infants live. The current study addressed this issue by asking whether neighborhood linguistic diversity predicts infants' propensity to learn from diverse social partners. Data were taken from a series of experiments in which 19-month-old infants from monolingual, English-speaking homes were tested in paradigms that assessed their tendency to imitate the actions of an adult who spoke either English or Spanish. Infants who lived in more linguistically diverse neighborhoods imitated more of the Spanish speaker's actions. This relation was observed in two separate datasets and found to be independent from variation in infants' general imitative abilities, age, median family income and population density. These results provide novel evidence suggesting that infants' social learning is predicted by the diversity of the communities in which they live. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

moral judgment by eliciting reactions to hypothetical scenarios such as
trolley problems. These thought experiments assume that participants
accept the outcomes stipulated in the scenarios. Across seven studies (N
= 968), we demonstrate that intuition overrides stipulated outcomes even
when participants are explicitly told that an action will result in a
particular outcome. Participants instead substitute their own estimates
of the probability of outcomes for stipulated outcomes, and these
probability estimates in turn influence moral judgments. Our findings
demonstrate that intuitive likelihoods are one critical factor in moral
judgment, one that is not suspended even in moral dilemmas that
explicitly stipulate outcomes. Features thought to underlie moral
reasoning, such as intention, may operate, in part, by affecting the
intuitive likelihood of outcomes, and, problematically, moral
differences between scenarios may be confounded with non-moral intuitive
probabilities.},

The origins of scientific thinking are claimed here to lie in attainments in epistemological understanding, beginning with the understanding achieved at about 4 years of age that assertions generated by human minds are distinguishable from an external reality against which they can be compared. Despite this achievement, children between 4 and 6 years of age exhibit an epistemological category mistake regarding the source of knowledge. They confuse a theory making it plausible that an event occurred and evidence indicating that the event did occur, as the source of their knowing that the event occurred. Appreciation of this distinction develops rapidly during this age range and reflects increasing mastery of an epistemological understanding we argue to be of foundational status for the development of scientific thinking, defined here as the consciously controlled coordination of theory and evidence.},

The beginning and end points of such a chain might in principle be rather dissimilar. There is also evidence supporting a contrasting picture: Languages tend to support efficient, informative communication, often through semantic categories in which all exemplars are similar. Here, we explore this tension through computational analyses of existing cross-language naming and sorting data from the domain of household containers. We find (a) formal evidence for historical semantic chaining, and (b) evidence that systems of categories in this domain nonetheless support near-optimally efficient communication. Our results demonstrate that semantic chaining is compatible with efficient communication, and they suggest that chaining may be constrained by the functional need for efficient communication.},

To evaluate the effect of knowledge overlap on the effectiveness of communication, participants played a communication game where the "director" identified objects to the "addressee". Pairs either shared information about most objects' names (high overlap), or about the minority of objects' names (low overlap). We found that high-overlap directors tended to use more names than low overlap directors. High overlap directors also used more names with objects whose names only they knew, thereby confusing their addressees more often than low-overlap directors.We conclude that while sharing more knowledge can be beneficial to communication overall, it can cause communication to be locally ineffective. Sharing more information reduces communication effectiveness precisely when there is an opportunity to inform---when people communicate information only they themselves know.},

	Abstract = {Sociologists suggest that children from socially advantaged families continue to learn during the summer, whereas children from disadvantaged families learn either little or lose ground. This disparity in summer learning is hypothesized to result from differential participation in educationally beneficial summer activities. In this article, we test this theory with current and nationally representative data, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Kindergarten Cohort. We examine how children's socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with their learning of literacy, mathematics, and general knowledge over the summer between kindergarten and the first grade. We also explore whether social-background differences in learning are explained by differential participation rates in summer activities. Our analytic models adjust for discrepancies between the timing of assessments and the timing of schools closing for the summer and opening in the fall. Much of the observed gain results from time in school. Nonetheless, social stratification characterizes summer learning between kindergarten and the first grade, with higher-SES children learning more. However, these social-background differences are only modestly explained by the activities in which children participate during the summer months.},

	Abstract = {Many theories of early word learning begin with the uncertainty inherent to learning a word from its co-occurrence with a visual scene. However, the relevant visual scene for infant word learning is neither from the adult theorist's view nor the mature partner's view, but is rather from the learner's personal view. Here we show that when 18-month old infants interacted with objects in play with their parents, they created moments in which a single object was visually dominant. If parents named the object during these moments of bottom-up selectivity, later forced-choice tests showed that infants learned the name, but did not when naming occurred during a less visually selective moment. The momentary visual input for parents and toddlers was captured via head cameras placed low on each participant's forehead as parents played with and named objects for their infant. Frame-by-frame analyses of the head camera images at and around naming moments were conducted to determine the visual properties at input that were associated with learning. The analyses indicated that learning occurred when bottom-up visual information was clean and uncluttered. The sensory-motor behaviors of infants and parents were also analyzed to determine how their actions on the objects may have created these optimal visual moments for learning. The results are discussed with respect to early word learning, embodied attention, and the social role of parents in early word learning. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

one for learners who must learn words from their co- occurrence with scenes, is reduced if object names are pro- vided when there is but one dominating object in the lear- ner's view.

Our data indicate that the ratings collected in this way are as valid and reliable as those collected in laboratory conditions (the correlation between our ratings and those collected in the lab from U.S. students reached .93 for a subsample of 2,500 monosyllabic words). We also show that our AoA ratings explain a substantial percentage of the variance in the lexical-decision data of the English Lexicon Project, over and above the effects of log frequency, word length, and similarity to other words. This is true not only for the lemmas used in our rating study, but also for their inflected forms. We further discuss the relationships of AoA with other predictors of word recognition and illustrate the utility of AoA ratings for research on vocabulary growth.},

	Abstract = {As adolescent Internet use grew exponentially in the last decade, with it emerged a number of correspondent expectations. Among them were the following: (1) that gender predicts usage, i.e., that boys spend more time online, surfing the web and playing violent games, while girls chat or shop online; (2) that Internet use causes social isolation and depression, especially for teens; and (3) that adolescents use the Internet for anonymous identity experimentation. These expectations were based on research with earlier technologies when the Internet was less diffused in the adolescent population. By means of highly detailed daily reports of adolescents' home Internet usage and peer-related adjustment, the present research sought to compare these expectations with the actual experiences of early and mid-adolescents in 2000 and 2001. Participants were 261 7th and 10th graders from suburban California public schools who completed four consecutive end-of-day reports on their school-based adjustment and Internet activity (including detailed logs of instant messages). Results challenge prevailing expectations regarding gender, well-being, and identity play. For the most part, adolescent boys' and girls' online activities have become more similar than different. On average, boys and girls alike described their online social interaction as (1) occurring in private settings such as e-mail and instant messages, (2) with friends who are also part of their daily, offline lives, and (3) devoted to fairly ordinary yet intimate topics (e.g., friends, gossip). No associations were found between Internet usage and well-being. Online pretending was reported to be motivated by a desire to play a joke on friends more often than to explore a desired or future identity, but participants reported a range of pretending content, contexts, and motives.},

	Abstract = {In referential communication, speakers refer to a target object among a set of context objects. The NPs they produce are characterized by a canonical order of prenominal adjectives: The dimensions that are easiest to detect (e.g., absolute dimensions) are commonly placed closer to the noun than other dimensions (e.g., relative dimensions). This stands in stark contrast to the assumption that language production is an incremental process. According to this incremental-procedural view, the dimensions that are easiest to detect should be named first. In the present paper, an alternative account of the canonical order effect is presented, suggesting that the prenominal adjective ordering rules are a result of the perceptual analysis processes underlying the evaluation of distinctive target features. Analyses of speakers' eye movements during referential communication (Experiment 1) and analyses of utterance formats produced under time pressure (Experiment 2) provide evidence for the suggested perceptual classification account. {\textcopyright} 2006 Psychology Press Ltd.},

Ninety-six participants (ages 5, 7, and 9) were interviewed about beliefs different from their own that were endorsed by characters with different status; their judgments of relativism, tolerance, and disagreeing persons were assessed. Five-year-olds made fewer relative and tolerant judgments than 7- and 9-year-olds. Nevertheless, participants of all ages organized their judgments according to the realm of diversity, thought that some beliefs are relative and some are nonrelative, and made tolerant judgments of some divergent beliefs (and their proponents) but not of others. The findings suggest that, in the early school years, children have multiple and well-differentiated perspectives on belief diversity.},

	Abstract = {How do people choose interventions to learn about causal systems? Here, we considered two possibilities. First, we test an information sampling model, information gain, which values interventions that can discriminate between a learner's hypotheses (i.e. possible causal structures). We compare this discriminatory model to a positive testing strategy that instead aims to confirm individual hypotheses. Experiment 1 shows that individual behavior is described best by a mixture of these two alternatives. In Experiment 2 we find that people are able to adaptively alter their behavior and adopt the discriminatory model more often after experiencing that the confirmatory strategy leads to a subjective performance decrement. In Experiment 3, time pressure leads to the opposite effect of inducing a change towards the simpler positive testing strategy. These findings suggest that there is no single strategy that describes how intervention decisions are made. Instead, people select strategies in an adaptive fashion that trades off their expected performance and cognitive effort.},

In the original article, Rossbach's affiliation was presented incorrectly. The correct affiliation is University of Bamberg, Bamberg Germany.] Without a doubt, math-related pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), pedagogical beliefs, and emotional attitudes are considered important dimensions of preschool teachers' professional competence. This research, however, documents that they are still understudied. This study focuses on certain aspects of the described dimensions: the sensitivity toward mathematical content in play-based situations, joy and interest in mathematics, the importance of mathematics as an educational area of preschool, and math-related emotional school experiences. The study explores the relationships among these factors with a group of 221 preschool teachers from 29 preschool centers in Germany. Background information, math-related school experiences, emotional attitudes, pedagogical beliefs, and aspects of PCK were obtained through a questionnaire. The findings of this study indicate that preschool teachers show some sensitivity toward mathematical content in play-based situations but do not show negative attitudes toward mathematics in general. Present joy and interest in mathematics are related to the rated relevance of preschool mathematics as an educational area. Their current emotional attitude toward mathematics predicts their sensitivity toward mathematical content. The results underline the importance of emotional aspects as facets of preschool teachers' professional competence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},

However, the effects of ID speech on infants' learning re- main poorly understood. The experiments reported here assess whether ID speech fa- cilitates word segmentation from fluent speech. One group of infants heard a set of nonsense sentences spoken with intonation contours characteristic of adult-directed (AD) speech, and the other group heard the same sentences spoken with intonation contours characteristic of ID speech. In both cases, the only cue to word boundaries was the statistical structure of the speech. Infants were able to distinguishwords from syllable sequences spanningword boundaries after exposure to ID speech but not af- ter hearingADspeech. These results suggest that ID speech facilitatesword segmen- tation and may be useful for other aspects of language acquisition as well. Issues of direction of preference in preferential listening paradigms are also considered.},

	Abstract = {86 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children were observed to evaluate the frequency of occurrence and conditions surrounding laughing and smiling. The following categories were used to classify events: whether it co-occurred with laughter or smiling; whether it was produced, responded to, or produced and responded to by the target child; whether it was judged an accidental or intentional attempt at humor; whether it was positive, negative, or neutral in intent; whether it was a verbal, motor, or verbal-motor event; and whether it occurred when the child was engaged in solitary, peer-parallel or peer cooperative play. An evaluation of 1,847 events indicated: (a) no differences between boys and girls in any category; (b) more events defined by smiling than by laughing; (c) an increase in laugh events and a decrease in smile events over age; (d) differences in event pattens co-occurring with laughing and smiling; and (e) 95{\%} of events occurred in the presence of other children or adults. Results were interpreted as supporting interpersonal theories of laughing and smiling and as calling into question theories stressing intrapersonal factors.},

	Abstract = {For the last 20 years, developmental psychologists have measured the variability in lexical development of infants and toddlers using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs) - the most widely used parental report forms for assessing language and communication skills in infants and toddlers. We show that CDI reports can serve as a basis for estimating infants' and toddlers'total vocabulary sizes, beyond serving as a tool for assessing their language development relative to other infants and toddlers. We investigate the link between estimated total vocabulary size and raw CDI scores from a mathematical perspective, using both single developmental trajectories and population data. The method capitalizes on robust regularities, such as the overlap of individual vocabularies observed across infants and toddlers, and takes into account both shared knowledge and idiosyncratic knowledge. This statistical approach enables researchers to approximate the total vocabulary size of an infant or a toddler, based on her raw MacArthur-Bates CDI score. Using the model, we propose new normative data for productive and receptive vocabulary in early childhood, as well as a tabulation that relates individual CDI measures to realistic lexical estimates. The correction required to estimate total vocabulary is non-linear, with a far greater impact at older ages and higher CDI scores. Therefore, we suggest that correlations of developmental indices to language skills should be made to vocabulary size as estimated by the model rather than to raw CDI scores.},

	Abstract = {While some word meanings, like "spotted," depend on in-tersubjectively accessible properties of the world, others like "pretty" invoke speakers' subjective beliefs. We explored children and adults' sensitivity to the subjectivity of a range of adjectives, including words like "spotted" and "pretty," but also words like "tall," which are evaluated relative to a standard. Participants saw two speakers who had independently experienced sets of exemplars of a novel object kind disagree about whether a critical exemplar was, e.g., "tall," "pretty," and "spotted." In Experiments 1 and 3, speakers had seen distinct sets of exemplars, while in Experiments 2 and 4, the sets were identical. Adults always judged disagreements over adjectives like "pretty" as faultless-indicating that both speakers "could be right"-and permitted less faultless disagreement for ones like "tall" when the speakers had been exposed to identical distributions. Strikingly, children did not respond in an adult-like manner until age 8 or 9, but their explanations for speakers' conflicting assertions suggested some sensitivity to the kinds of knowledge relevant for evaluating different adjectives.},

@article{Nelson2012,
	Abstract = {Brian A. Nosek and Yoav Bar-Anan's (this issue) scientific utopia is quite appealing. The narrative of Hari Seldon's productive morning, which concludes the article, depicts many of the ideals at the core of science. Ideas are celebrated, arguments are pursued to increase collective knowledge, and clarity of thought is rewarded in all corners of the academic community. Indeed, there is not much to dislike about this vision of the future (though one might quibble with the lack of nonacademic conversation in Seldon's life). Like many utopian narratives, Seldon's life is also tidy to the point of austerity. Reviewers are thoughtful even when disagreeable, discourse is sensible and produc-tive, and insight is seemingly encumbered only by the speed of light. The ugly detritus of imperfect science has been eliminated by the procedural and incentive-based efficiencies of modern life. This future sounds amazing. But maybe it is not as amazing as it sounds. Nosek and Bar-Anan outline a series of inefficiencies in cur-rent scientific communication and then lay out their utopian solution. The existence of those inefficien-cies is inarguable, as is the sensibleness of many of Nosek and Bar-Anan's proposed solutions. For exam-ple, we agree that there is no longer a need for page limits, long lags between acceptance and publication, and prohibitive journal subscription fees. Separating research production from for-profit publishing houses seems like a goal well worth the adjustment costs. But we worry that certain features of Hari Seldon's world will lead to more ugly detritus and less pristine knowl-edge. In particular, we focus on two concerns. When all findings are made available, (a) it is harder to dis-criminate the true findings from the false findings, and (b) there will be more false findings.

However, speech from other speakers and speech directed to others constitute a large amount of the linguistic environment. What are the properties of infant-directed speech that differentiate it from other com- ponents of infants' speech environment? To what extent should these other aspects be considered as part of the linguistic input? This review examines the characteristics of the speech input to preverbal infants, including phonological, morphological, and syntactic characteristics, specifically how these properties might support language development. While maternal, infant-directed speech is privileged in the input, other aspects of the environment, such as adult-directed speech, may also play a role. Furthermore, the input is variable in nature, dependent on the age and linguistic development of the infant, the social context, and the interaction between the infant and speakers in the environment.},

	Abstract = {The relation between humor comprehension and humor production was examined. Unlike earlier studies that used comprehension tasks requiring a productive component, here participants simply decided whether cartoons were matched or mismatched to presented ``latent content'' (i.e., the implied meaning of the cartoon). To test humor production, the same participants devised humorous captions for photographs, which judges reliably rated on funniness. Performance on the two tasks showed a significant positive correlation. Relations between response time, confidence, and funniness ratings in the comprehension task were consistent with an ``insight'' view of humor comprehension: correct responses were made more quickly, and matched latent content trials were identified faster and were rated as funnier than mismatched trials. In the humor production task, judged funniness showed a reliable (but rather small) positive correlation with response time, offering little support for an ``insight'' view of humor production. Limitations of the study and possibilities for future research on humor production, modeled on creativity research, are discussed.

	Abstract = {The problem of replicating the flexibility of human common-sense reasoning has captured the imagination of computer scientists since the early days of Alan Turing's foundational work on computation and the philosophy of arti{\^{}}Lcial intelligence. In the intervening years, the idea of cognition as computation has emerged as a fundamental tenet of Arti{\^{}}Lcial Intelligence (AI) and cognitive science. But what kind of computation is cognition? We describe a computational formalism centered around a probabilistic Turing machine called QUERY, which captures the operation of probabilis- tic conditioning via conditional simulation. Through several examples and analyses, we demonstrate how the QUERY abstraction can be used to cast common-sense reasoning as probabilistic inference in a statistical model of our observations and the uncertain structure of the world that generated that ex- perience. This formulation is a recent synthesis of several research programs in AI and cognitive science, but it also represents a surprising convergence of several of Turing's pioneering insights in AI, the foundations of computation, and statistics.},

	Abstract = {The disparity in the amount and quality of language that low-income children hear relative to their more-affluent peers is often referred to as the 30-million-word gap. Here, we expand the literature about this disparity by reporting the relative contributions of the quality of early parent-child communication and the quantity of language input in 60 low-income families. Including both successful and struggling language learners from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, we noted wide variation in the quality of nonverbal and verbal interactions (symbol-infused joint engagement, routines and rituals, fluent and connected communication) at 24 months, which accounted for 27{\%} of the variance in expressive language 1 year later. These indicators of quality were considerably more potent predictors of later language ability than was the quantity of mothers' words during the interaction or sensitive parenting. Bridging the word gap requires attention to how caregivers and children establish a communication foundation within low-income families.},

	Abstract = {Deictic time words (e.g., " tomorrow, " " yesterday ") refer to time periods relative to the present moment. While children produce these words by age 2-3, they use them incorrectly for several more years. Here, as a case study in abstract word learning, we explored what children know about these words during this delay. Specifically, we probed children's knowledge of three aspects of meaning: deictic (past/future) status, sequential ordering (e.g., " tomorrow " is after " yesterday "), and remoteness from now. We asked 3-to 8-year-olds to place these words on a timeline extending from the past (left) to the future (right). Even 4-year-olds could meaningfully represent the words' deictic status and order, and by 6, the majority displayed adult-like performance. Adult-like knowledge of remoteness, however, emerged independently, after age 7. Thus, even while children use these terms incorrectly, they are gradually constructing a structured semantic domain, including information about the deictic, sequential, and metric relations among terms.},

	Abstract = {Most words are associated with multiple senses. A DVD can be round (when describing a disc), and a DVD can be an hour long (when describing a movie), and in each case DVD means something different. The possible senses of a word are often predictable, and also constrained, as words cannot take just any meaning: for example, although a movie can be an hour long, it cannot sensibly be described as round (unlike a DVD). Learning the scope and limits of word meaning is vital for the comprehension of natural language, but poses a potentially difficult learnability problem for children. By testing what senses children are willing to assign to a variety of words, we demonstrate that, in comprehension, the problem is solved using a productive learning strategy. Children are perfectly capable of assigning different senses to a word; indeed they are essentially adult-like at assigning licensed meanings. But difficulties arise in determining which senses are assignable: children systematically overestimate the possible senses of a word, allowing meanings that adults rule unlicensed (e.g., taking round movie to refer to a disc). By contrast, this strategy does not extend to production, in which children use licensed, but not unlicensed, senses. Children's productive comprehension strategy suggests an early emerging facility for using context in sense resolution (a difficult task for natural language processing algorithms), but leaves an intriguing question as to the mechanisms children use to learn a restricted, adult-like set of senses. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.The seeds of grape represent about 15{\%} of solid waste produced in the wine industry; thus, this is the reason that seeds are traditionally sold for the oil extraction. In this research were determined the physicochemical characteristics and the antibacterial activity of oil grape seed (Vitis vinifera), Malvasia variety. The oil was extracted by the Soxhlet method, using n-hexane as a solvent and extraction time of 5 hours. The extracted oil was characterized physicochemically by COVENIN and AOAC methods. The antibacterial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method against bacterial strains Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25823, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Escherichia coli ATCC 35218. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was also determined by the broth dilution method. The maximum yield of grape seed oil was 8.90{\%} p.p-1 at 5 hours of extraction. The physicochemical characterization of the oil was relative density (0.8523), refractive index (1.4660), titratable acidity (1.32{\%} oleic acid), saponification value (245.7 mg KOH.g-1); index peroxide (112.7 meq O2.kg-1) and index of Iodine (153.54 cgI2.g-1). With regard to the antibacterial activity, the extracted oil had activity type bactericidal against all bacterial type bacteria tested and MIC for B. cereus, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. coli was 10{\%} while for B. subtilis was 40{\%}. The results indicated that the grape seed oil Malvasia variety can be used as food additive to combat potential pathogenic bacteria.},

@article{Gibson2013b,
	Abstract = {Sentence processing theories typically assume that the input to our language processing mechanisms is an error-free sequence of words. However, this assumption is an oversimplification because noise is present in typical language use (for instance, due to a noisy environment, producer errors, or perceiver errors). A complete theory of human sentence comprehension therefore needs to explain how humans understand language given imperfect input. Indeed, like many cognitive systems, language processing mechanisms may even be "well designed"--in this case for the task of recovering intended meaning from noisy utterances. In particular, comprehension mechanisms may be sensitive to the types of information that an idealized statistical comprehender would be sensitive to. Here, we evaluate four predictions about such a rational (Bayesian) noisy-channel language comprehender in a sentence comprehension task: (i) semantic cues should pull sentence interpretation towards plausible meanings, especially if the wording of the more plausible meaning is close to the observed utterance in terms of the number of edits; (ii) this process should asymmetrically treat insertions and deletions due to the Bayesian "size principle"; such nonliteral interpretation of sentences should (iii) increase with the perceived noise rate of the communicative situation and (iv) decrease if semantically anomalous meanings are more likely to be communicated. These predictions are borne out, strongly suggesting that human language relies on rational statistical inference over a noisy channel.},

The adjustments that parents do when they speak to children are similar across all three vocabulary groups; they use longer utterances than when speaking to adults, and respond faster to children than they do to other adults. However, overall pause duration varies with the vocabulary size of the children, and as a result durational aspects of the language environment to which the children are exposed differ between groups. Parents of children in the large vocabulary size group respond faster to child utterances than do parents of children in the typical vocabulary size group, who in turn respond faster to child utterances than do parents of children in the small vocabulary size group.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Four experiments demonstrate that walking boosts creative ideation in real time and shortly after. In Experiment 1, while seated and then when walking on a treadmill, adults completed Guilford's alternate uses (GAU) test of creative divergent thinking and the compound remote associates (CRA) test of convergent thinking. Walking increased 81{\%} of participants' creativity on the GAU, but only increased 23{\%} of participants' scores for the CRA. In Experiment 2, participants completed the GAU when seated and then walking, when walking and then seated, or when seated twice. Again, walking led to higher GAU scores. Moreover, when seated after walking, participants exhibited a residual creative boost. Experiment 3 generalized the prior effects to outdoor walking. Experiment 4 tested the effect of walking on creative analogy generation. Participants sat inside, walked on a treadmill inside, walked outside, or were rolled outside in a wheelchair. Walking outside produced the most novel and highest quality analogies. The effects of outdoor stimulation and walking were separable. Walking opens up the free flow of ideas, and it is a simple and robust solution to the goals of increasing creativity and increasing physical activity. People have noted that walking seems to have a special relation to creativity. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1889) wrote, " All truly great thoughts are conceived by walking " (Aphorism 34). The current research puts such observations on solid footing. Four studies demonstrate that walking increases creative ideation. The effect is not simply due to the increased perceptual stimulation of moving through an environment, but rather it is due to walking. Whether one is outdoors or on a treadmill, walking improves the generation of novel yet appropriate ideas, and the effect even extends to when people sit down to do their creative work shortly after.},

Ekman and W. V.

Ss who showed a set of facial actions hypothesized to be signs of various negative affects reported experiencing more negative emotion than Ss who did not show these actions. How much these facial actions were shown was related to the reported intensity of negative affect. Specific facial actions associated with the experience of disgust are identified.

	Abstract = {Infants intentionally communicate with others from before their 1st birthday. But there is some question about how they understand the communicative process. Do they understand that for their request to work the recipient must both understand the request and be cooperatively disposed to fulfill it? On the basis of the study by Shwe and Markman (1997), we developed a new paradigm that tested whether and how 18-, 24-, and 30-month-old children repair a failed request. Children at all ages repaired their requests in the case of a misunderstanding even if they had obtained the requested object already. They also repaired differently depending on the precise reason for the communicative failure (e.g., misunderstanding the referent versus the communicative intent) and did not repair in the case of correct understanding, even if they did not get the requested object. Thus, from very early in their communicative careers, young children operate with a basic understanding of the mental and cooperative nature of human communication.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we develop an account of the types of experiences through which speakers learn to design their utterances for particular addressees. We argue that there are two important aspects of conversational situations relevant to considerations of audience design. First, speakers must become aware that audience design is necessary in the current setting. Second, they must frequently overcome other tendencies toward consistency and brevity of expression. To assess the impact of both of these factors, we conducted a referential communication experiment in which Directors described arrays of picture cards for two independent Matchers. In the early rounds, both Matchers were present and each possessed a different subset of the Di-rectors{\~{O}} cards. In later rounds, only one of the two Matchers was present at a time and worked with the entire set of cards. We evaluated the degree to which Directors{\~{O}} descriptions showed evidence of audience design by focusing on critical rounds when the Directors described cards that the current Matcher had not previously shared. Directors generally appeared sensitive to the distinction between shared and nonshared items. Additionally , there was more evidence of adjustment at the second partner change, suggesting that the Directors had learned something about the kinds of descriptions required in this situation. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the nature of speakers{\~{O}} experiences of interacting in a particular situation when making claims about the presence or absence of audience design. {\'{O}}},

	Abstract = {This study examines the nature of child-directed speech (CDS) from the perspective of functions [M.A.K. Halliday, Learning how to mean: Explorations in the development of language, Elsevier North-Holland, Inc., New York, 1977] and social interactionist theory. It is argued that previous explanations of CDS, often called motherese or caregiver speech, have either minimalized or neglected the functionalist-interactionist dimension of input in language acquisition. Far from being merely a novel way of describing the language caregivers use with infants, CDS is presented as a crucial catalyst in the complex process of L1 acquisition. At the heart of CDS is negotiation between caregiver(s) and infant. The infant need not always respond with complete or near-complete linguistic units or constituents such as an adult might during a given negotiation, yet the context of the negotiation remains crucial to the infant. As physical maturation increases and the infant begins to produce more adult-like utterances, the negotiation between interlocutors becomes more balanced, syntactically and phonologically, but not necessarily semantically/functionally. This paper presents the results of a case study which specifically examines the utterances or input which family members direct at a Japanese infant during the early part of his language development. The data generated by the subject and his parents provide an interesting glimpse into one of the ways in which infants absorb language. The results of the data analysis show that while the parents of the subject were seen to use roughlye qual amounts of language with the child, the distribution of language functions used by the mother was importantly different from that used by the father; therefore, it is suggested that this difference in CDS aids the language development of the infant by providing more interactive negotiation, which is argued to be the crucial factor in language development. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Explanations play an important role in learning and inference. People often learn by seeking explanations, and they assess the viability of hypotheses by considering how well they explain the data. An emerging body of work reveals that both children and adults have strong and systematic intuitions about what constitutes a good explanation, and that these explanatory preferences have a systematic impact on explanation-based processes. In particular, people favor explanations that are simple and broad, with the consequence that engaging in explanation can shape learning and inference by leading people to seek patterns and favor hypotheses that support broad and simple explanations. Given the prevalence of explanation in everyday cognition, understanding explanation is therefore crucial to understanding learning and inference.},

	Abstract = {In conversation, speakers and addressees work together in the making of a definite reference. In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance. ?? 1986.},

Children's interpretations were affected by their experience with relations in compounds with the same head, but not by overall relation frequency. Adults' interpretations were affected by their experience with relations in compounds with the same modifier, suggesting that children and adults use similar but different knowledge to interpret compounds.

	Abstract = {Speakers in conversation routinely engage in audience design. That is, they construct their utterances to be understood by particular addressees. Standard accounts of audi- ence design have frequently appealed to the notion of common ground. On this view, speakers produce well-designed utterances by expressly considering the knowledge they take as shared with addressees. This article suggests that conversational com- mon ground, rather than being a category of specialized mental representations, is more usefully conceptualized as an emergent property of ordinary memory pro- cesses. This article examines 2 separate but equally important processes: commonal- ity assessment and message formation. Commonality assessment involves the re- trieval of memory traces concerning what information is shared with an addressee, whereas message formation involves deciding howto use that information in conver- sation. Evidence from the CallHome English corpus of telephone conversations shows how each of these processes is rooted in basic aspects of human memory. The overall goal of this article is to demonstrate the need for a more cognitive psychologi- cal account of conversational common ground.},

In Study 1, children were experimentally assigned to either explain or observe the mechanical toy. In Study 2, children were classified according to whether the content of their response to an undirected prompt involved explanation. Dependent measures included whether children understood the toy's functional-mechanical relationships, remembered perceptual features of the toy, effectively reconstructed the toy, and (for Study 2) generalized the function of the toy when constructing a new one. Results demonstrate that across age groups, explanation promotes causal learning and generalization but does not improve (and in younger children can even impair) memory for causally irrelevant perceptual details. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

	Abstract = {Recent neurobiological studies have advanced the hypothesis that language development is not continuously plastic but is governed by biological constraints that may be modified by experience within a particular time window. This hypothesis is tested based on spontaneous speech data from deaf cochlear-implanted (CI) children with access to linguistic stimuli at different developmental times. Language samples of nine children who received a CI between 5 and 19 months are analysed for linguistic measures representing different stages of language development. These include canonical babbling ratios, vocabulary diversity, and functional elements such as determiners. The results show that language development is positively related to the age at which children get first access to linguistic input and that later access to language is associated with a slower-than-normal language-learning rate. As such, the positive effect of early experience on the functional organisation of the brain in language processes is confirmed by behavioural performance.},

	Abstract = {Experimental studies demonstrate that contrast helps toddlers to extend the meanings of novel adjectives. This study explores whether antonym co-occurrence in spontaneous speech also has an effect on adjective use by the child. The authors studied adjective production in longitudinal speech samples from 16 children (16--36 months) acquiring eight different languages. Adjectives in child speech and child-directed speech were coded as either unrelated or related to a contrastive term in the preceding context. Results show large differences between children in the growth of adjective production. These differences are strongly related to contrast use. High contrast users not only increase adjective use earlier, but also reach a stable level of adjective production in the investigated period. Average or low contrast users increase their adjective production more slowly and do not reach a plateau in the period covered by this study. Initially there is a strong relation between contrast use in child speech and child-directed speech, but this relation diminishes with age.

	Abstract = {Traditional mechanistic accounts of language processing derive almost entirely from the study of monologue. Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.},
	Annote = {The interactive alignment model assumes that successful dialogue involves the development of aligned representa- tions by the interlocutors. This occurs by priming mechanisms at each level of linguistic representation, by percola- tion between the levels so that alignment at one level enhances alignment at other levels, and by repair mechanisms when alignment goes awry

On the autonomous transmission account, the processes employed in production and comprehension need not draw upon the same representations (see Fig. 3). By contrast, the interactive alignment model assumes that the processor draws upon the same representations (see Fig. 2). This parity means that a representation that has just been con- structed for the purposes of comprehension can then be used for production (or vice versa).

----
Achieving alignment of situation models:
global alignment of models results from local alignment at level of ling representations: hearing an utterance that activates a particular aspect of a situation model will make it more likely that the person will use an utterance consistent with that aspect of the model.
- evidence from eyetracking that whatever constrains speaker's situation model also constrain listeners

Alignment at other levels:
- lexical, syntactic
- articulatory representations primed by perception
- accent and speech rate 
- speakers may prefer interlocutors to respond with an aligned form

Alignment at one level leads to alignment at another
- G {\&} A (1987) once word introduced with particular interpretation, not normally used with another in a particular stretch of dialogue; aligned use went along with aligned interpretation
- interlocutors develop lexicon of expressions relevant to dialogue using principle of contrast 
- syntactic alignment enhanced if verb repeated
- semantic relations between lexical items enhance sytactic priming
- parallelism, interpreting compounds in one relation facilitates interpretation of future ones in same

Recovery from misalignment
- primitive processes are not foolproof

I.A.M. of dialogue processing
- production and comprehension processes are coupled: In formulating an utterance the speaker is guided by what has just been said to him and in comprehending the utterance the listener is constrained by what the speaker has just said. 
- interlocutors build up utterances as a joint activity (Clark 1996), with interlocutors often interleaving production and comprehension tightly

Alignment channels
- priming mechanism that drives interactive alignment
- activation of a representation in one interlocutor leads to the activation of the matching representation in the other interlocutor DIRECTLY (no intervening ``decision box'' where the listener makes a decision about how to respond to the ``signal.'' Although such decisions do of course take place during dialogue, they do not form part of the basic interactive alignment process, which is automatic and largely unconscious

Parity between comprehension and production
- processor draws on same representations: one that has just been constructed for purpose of comprehension can then be used for production

Common ground, misalignment, and interactive repair
- Instead of modeling one's interlocutor's mental state, account assumes alignment of situation models follows from lower-level alignment, much more automatic
- interlocutors align on implicit common ground, shared information which does not derive from explicitly modeling others' beliefs, and only go beyond this to full common ground when necessary 
- Common ground reflects what can reasonably be assumed to be known to both interlocutors on the basis of the evidence at hand. This evidence can be non-linguistic (e.g., if both know that they come from the same city, they can assume a degree of common knowledge about that city; if both admire the same view and it is apparent to both that they do so, they can infer a common perspective) or can be based on the prior conversation.
- requires interlocutor to maintain complex situation model that reflects both own and shared knowledge
- implicit common ground effective because interlocutor builds up a situation model that contains (or at least foregrounds) information that the interlocutor has processed (either by producing that information or compre- hending it). But because the other interlocutor is also present, he comprehends what the first interlocutor produces and vice versa. This means that both interlocutors foreground the same information, and therefore tend to make the same additions to their situation models

Limits on common ground inference
- evidence that speakers typically formulate utterances without reference to unshared knowledge, or do so only when discrepancy is made very obvious
- argue that performing inference about common ground is an optional strategy that interlocutors employ only when resources allow

Interactive repair using implicit common ground
- basic because only relies on the speaker checking the conversation in relation to his own knowledge of the situation
- interactive repair mechanism relies on:
1) checking whether one can straightforwardly interpret the input in relation to one's own representation
2) when this fails, reformulating the utterance in a way that leads to the establishment of implicit common ground
- clarification requests reflect failures to understand what the speaker is saying in relation to listener's own model
- This repair process can be regarded as involving a kind of dialogue inference, but notice that it is externalized, in the sense that it can only operate via the interaction between the interlocutors.

Interactive repair using full common ground
- strategic processes overlaid on basic alignment mechanism
- particularly likely when one speaker trying to deceive or concel infor or deliberately not aligning
- normal convo does not routinely require modeling interlocutor's mind

Routines in production
- speakers can draw on representations that have been largely or entirely formed already (e.g., simply repeating previous speaker's utterance)
- it is possible that people can short-circuit parts of the production process just as they may be able to short-circuit comprehension
- ROUTINE is an expression that is ``fixed'' to a relatively great extent, particular meaning, syntactic analysis, pragmatic use, phonological characteristics
- set up on the fly during dialogue through routinization

Routinization in dialogue DUE TO INTERACTIVE ALIGNMENT
- repeated expression with same analysis and interpretation is aligned at most linguistic levels
- use of routines contributes enormously to the fluency of dialogue in comparison to most monologue -- interlocutors have a smaller space of alternatives to consider and have ready ac- cess to particular words, grammatical constructions, and concepts
- In other words, what actually occurs in dialogue is lots of lexical, syntactic, and semantic activation of various tokens at each level, and activation of particular links between the levels. This leads to a great deal of alignment, and hence the production of routines. It also means that the production of a word or utterance in dialogue is only distantly related to the production of a word or utterance in isolation
- may be possible to break this
rigid order of sentence production, and instead to build a sentence ``around'' a particular phrase if that phrase has been focused in the dialogue.

Alignment in comprehension
local context is so central that the frequency of an expression (or, e.g., its age of acquisition) should become far less important.

Self-monitoring
moni- toring is a by-product of a language processing system that is sufficiently flexible to allow comprehension and produc- tion to occur to some extent simultaneously in dialogue. This means that monitoring should tend to be hard during periods of overlapping speech. Furthermore, monitoring is a key part of the checking and interactive repair process dis- cussed in section 4.3. As a speaker you have to monitor your own contributions with respect to the implicit common ground and as a listener you have to monitor your partner's contributions with respect to the same implicit common ground.},

	Abstract = {Syntactic knowledge is widely held to be partially innate, rather than learned. In a classic example, it is sometimes argued that children know the proper use of anaphoric one, although that knowledge could not have been learned from experience. Lidz et al. [Lidz, J., Waxman, S., {\&} Freedman, J. (2003). What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: Experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months. Cognition, 89, B65-B73.] pursue this argument, and present corpus and experimental evidence that appears to support it; they conclude that specific aspects of this knowledge must be innate. We demonstrate, contra Lidz et al., that this knowledge may in fact be acquired from the input, through a simple Bayesian learning procedure. The learning procedure succeeds because it is sensitive to the absence of particular input patterns--an aspect of learning that is apparently overlooked by Lidz et al. More generally, we suggest that a prominent form of the "argument from poverty of the stimulus" suffers from the same oversight, and is as a result logically unsound.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive theory from the field of general anxiety suggests that the tendency to  display attentional bias toward negative information results in anxiety. Accordingly, the current study aims to investigate whether attentional bias is involved in math anxiety (MA) as well (i.e., a persistent negative reaction to math). Twenty seven participants (14 with high levels of MA and 13 with low levels of MA) were presented with a novel computerized numerical version of the well established dot probe task. One of six types of prime stimuli, either math related or typically neutral, was presented on one side of a computer screen. The prime was preceded by a probe (either one or two asterisks) that appeared in either the prime or the opposite location. Participants had to discriminate probe identity (one or two asterisks). Math anxious individuals reacted faster when the probe was at the location of the numerical related stimuli. This suggests the existence of attentional bias in MA. That is, for math anxious individuals, the cognitive system selectively favored the processing of emotionally negative information (i.e., math related words). These findings suggest that attentional bias is linked to unduly intense MA symptoms.},

	Abstract = {The claim that Eskimo languages have words for different types of snow is well-known among the public, but has been greatly exaggerated through popularization and is therefore viewed with skepticism by many scholars of language. Despite the prominence of this claim, to our knowledge the line of reasoning behind it has not been tested broadly across languages. Here, we note that this reasoning is a special case of the more general view that language is shaped by the need for efficient communication, and we empirically test a variant of it against multiple sources of data, including library reference works, Twitter, and large digital collections of linguistic and meteorological data. Consistent with the hypothesis of efficient communication, we find that languages that use the same linguistic form for snow and ice tend to be spoken in warmer climates, and that this association appears to be mediated by lower communicative need to talk about snow and ice. Our results confirm that variation in semantic categories across languages may be traceable in part to local communicative needs. They suggest moreover that despite its awkward history, the topic of "words for snow" may play a useful role as an accessible instance of the principle that language supports efficient communication.},

	Abstract = {--- Successful communication depends in part on an ability to anticipate miscommunication. We investigated speakers' ability to gauge their addressees' understanding. Participants in our experiments were asked to say ambiguous sentences while attempting to convey a spe-cific intention to their addressee. When they estimated the addressee's understanding of the intended meaning, they showed a consistent ten-dency to overestimate their effectiveness. They expected the addressee to understand more often than the addressee actually did. In contrast, overhearers who were informed about the speakers' intention did not systematically overestimate the speakers' effectiveness. Our findings suggest that when speakers monitor their own utterances, they do not act as unbiased observers. Instead, they underestimate the ambiguity of their own utterances and overestimate the extent to which their dis-ambiguating cues make their intention transparent. Such overestima-tion could be a systematic source of miscommunication in natural conversation, and should be accounted for by any theory of language production. An American psycholinguist (M.G.) participated in a conference in Canada. At the banquet, her table wanted to order wine that would match the food. She approached the waiter and said, " Excuse me, but could you tell me what the entree is? " He looked a bit baffled at first and then very slowly said, " Well, it's the course that comes after the salad but before the dessert. " Apparently M.G. did not appreciate the ambiguity of her own question. In the study we report here, we inves-tigated the possibility that speakers in general underestimate the ambi-guity of their utterances, and that consequently they overestimate their ability to convey what they intend. We suggest that the very attempt to communicate contains the seeds of miscommunication.},

	Abstract = {Deaf children are frequently reported to be at risk for difficulties in executive function (EF); however, the literature is divided over whether these difficulties are the result of deafness itself or of delays/deficits in language that often co-occur with deafness. The purpose of this study is to discriminate these hypotheses by assessing Ef in populations where the 2 accounts make contrasting predictions. We use a between-groups design involving 116 children, ages 5-12 years, across 3 groups: (a) participants with normal hearing (n = 45), (b) deaf native signers who had access to American Sign Language from birth (n = 45), and (c) oral cochlear implant users who did not have full access to language prior to cochlear implantation (n = 26). Measures include both parent report and performance-based assessments of EF. Parent report results suggest that early access to language has a stronger impact on EF than early access to sound. Performance-based results trended in a similar direction, but no between-group differences were significant. These results indicate that healthy EF skills do not require audition and therefore that difficulties in this domain do not result primarily from a lack of auditory experience. Instead, results are consistent with the hypothesis that language proficiency, whether in sign or speech, is crucial for the development of healthy EF. Further research is needed to test whether sign language proficiency also confers benefits to deaf children from hearing families.},

Measures of effortful control, false belief understanding, and the inhibitory control and attention-shifting aspects of executive function in preschool were related to measures of math and literacy ability in kindergarten. Results indicated that the various aspects of child self-regulation accounted for unique variance in the academic outcomes independent of general intelligence and that the inhibitory control aspect of executive function was a prominent correlate of both early math and reading ability. Findings suggest that curricula designed to improve self-regulation skills as well as enhance early academic abilities may be most effective in helping children succeed in school.},

The study demonstrates the feasibility of testing rudimentary executive function skills among preschoolers, using an original battery of tasks. The results were consistent with those from studies of older children (e.g. Welsh, Pennington {\&} Groisser, 1991), in that three aspects of executive function were distinguished: working memory, attentional flexibility and inhibitory control. In addition, specific links were found between executive function and theory-of-mind performance, even when age and both verbal and non-verbal ability were taken into account. In particular, children's deceptive abilities were closely related to success on tests of inhibitory control. The implications of these results for our understanding of deceit are discussed.},

Results demonstrate that young children, like adults, view animal categories as natural kinds, but artifact categories as more conventionalized.

We discuss two phenomena which pose a ¨ challenge to these accounts of pragmatics: M-implicatures (Horn, 1984) and embedded implicatures which violate Hurford's constraint (Chierchia, Fox {\&} Spector, 2012; Hurford, 1974). Previous models cannot derive these implicatures, because of basic limitations in their architecture. In order to explain these phenomena, we propose a realignment of the division between semantic content and pragmatic content. Under this proposal, the semantic content of an utterance is not fixed independent of pragmatic inference; rather, pragmatic inference partially determines an utterance's semantic content. We show how semantic inference can be realized as an extension to the Rational Speech Acts framework (Goodman {\&} Stuhlmuller, 2013). The ¨ addition of lexical uncertainty derives both M-implicatures and the relevant embedded implicatures, and preserves the derivations of more standard implicatures.},

	Abstract = {Language use can be viewed as a form of joint activity that requires the coordination of mean- ing between individuals. Because the linguistic signal is notoriously ambiguous, interlocutors need to draw upon additional sources of information to resolve ambiguity and achieve shared understanding. One way individuals can achieve coordination is by using inferences about the interlocutor's intentions and mental states to adapt their behavior. However, such an inferential process can be demanding in terms of both time and cognitive resources. Here, we suggest that interaction provides interlocutors with many cues that can support coordination of meaning, even when they are neither produced intentionally for that purpose nor interpreted as signaling speak- ers' intention. In many circumstances, interlocutors can take advantage of these cues to adapt their behavior in ways that promote coordination, bypassing the need to resort to deliberative inferential processes.},

@article{Lyness2013,
	Abstract = {Cochlear implants (CI) are the most successful intervention for ameliorating hearing loss in severely or profoundly deaf children. Despite this, educational performance in children with CI continues to lag behind their hearing peers. From animal models and human neuroimaging studies it has been proposed the integrative functions of auditory cortex are compromised by crossmodal plasticity. This has been argued to result partly from the use of a visual language. Here we argue that 'cochlear implant sensitive periods' comprise both auditory and language sensitive periods, and thus cannot be fully described with animal models. Despite prevailing assumptions, there is no evidence to link the use of a visual language to poorer CI outcome. Crossmodal reorganisation of auditory cortex occurs regardless of compensatory strategies, such as sign language, used by the deaf person. In contrast, language deprivation during early sensitive periods has been repeatedly linked to poor language outcomes. Language sensitive periods have largely been ignored when considering variation in CI outcome, leading to ill-founded recommendations concerning visual language in CI habilitation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results of constrained learning are representations that themselves are transformed during development.

	Abstract = {Most current accounts of color word acquisition propose that the delay between children's first production of color words and adult-like understanding is due to problems abstracting color as a domain of meaning. Here we present evidence against this hypothesis, and show that, from the time children produce color words in a labeling task they use them to represent color. In Experiment 1, an analysis of early color word errors finds that, before acquiring adult-like understanding, children make systematic hypotheses about color word meanings, which are best characterized as overextensions of adult meanings. Using a comprehension task, Experiment 2 finds that these overextensions are due to overly broad color categories, rather than a communicative strategy. These results indicate that the delay between production and adult-like understanding of color words is not due to difficulties abstracting color, but is largely attributable to the problem of determining the color boundaries marked by specific languages. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Personal finances are becoming an increasingly prominent source of distress for a substantial proportion of the population in many developed economies. In this paper, we examine the organizational consequences of this trend by proposing that financial precarity can undermine a person's ability to perform at work. Across two studies, we demonstrate that people who are worried about their financial situation have less cognitive capacity available to them, which subsequently spills over into their work performance. In Study 1, we demonstrate this relationship in a field study with short-haul truck drivers where we combine survey responses with lagged archival data on preventable accidents. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in financial worry is associated with a 0.4{\%} increase in the probability of a preventable accident because of its detrimental effects on cognitive capacity. In Study 2, we establish the causal ordering among the variables by manipulating financial worry in a laboratory environ...},

	Abstract = {It is a contention of the culturalist strand of underclass theory that the growth of the underclass is not a function of social and economic change, but of features intrinsic to underclass culture. Children born into disadvantaged communities, it is argued, are socialized into the `deviant' culture of their families, families typi- cally headed by single mothers. According to the underclass thesis, daughters of such families will face a heightened risk of leaving school early and teenage preg- nancy. An unanticipated correlation between claims of the underclass thesis and the cohort of mothers and daughters with whom we are working on a current project has led us to ask, `how do we acknowledge the culture of disadvantaged communities and their generational synergies, whilst avoiding the pernicious implications of the underclass thesis?'To answer this question, this article assesses the merits of bringing Bourdieu's ideas on cultural capital together with Sarah Thornton's concept of subcultural capital. The article concludes with two examples of how we might draw on these ideas as a way of exploring the means by which girls in difficult economic circumstances understand and pursue their school lives.},

Subjective ratings of acquisition ages have been successfully employed to study the effect of age of acquisition (AoA). Although a large number of norms exist in many languages, fewer are available for German. Therefore, subjective AoA ratings for 3,259 German words were collected online, includ-ing 2,363 nouns and 473 verbs. These words were presented in lists of 140 words, and participants rated the age in years at which they had first learned each word. A split-half correla-tion testified to a high internal reliability. There were also high correlations with rated AoA values for subsets of the items that had been collected in previous studies, in both German and English. Age and gender were found to influence the ratings very weakly, in that older and male participants tended to give slightly higher age ratings. Education, multilingualism, and frequent usage of languages other than German did not exert an influence on the rating values. These new ratings will ex-tend the currently existing norms available for language and reading research across languages and will provide re-searchers with a wider choice of word stimuli. The ratings are available expressed in two measurements: age in years, and AoA rated on a 7-point Likert scale.},

	Abstract = {Reading regularly with young children stimulates optimal patterns of brain development and strengthens parent-child relationships at a critical time in child development, which, in turn, builds language, literacy, and social-emotional skills that last a lifetime. Pediatric providers have a unique opportunity to encourage parents to engage in this important and enjoyable activity with their children beginning in infancy. Research has revealed that parents listen and children learn as a result of literacy promotion by pediatricians, which provides a practical and evidence-based opportunity to support early brain development in primary care practice. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatric providers promote early literacy development for children beginning in infancy and continuing at least until the age of kindergarten entry by (1) advising all parents that reading aloud with young children can enhance parent-child relationships and prepare young minds to learn language and early literacy skills; (2) counseling all parents about developmentally appropriate shared-reading activities that are enjoyable for children and their parents and offer language-rich exposure to books, pictures, and the written word; (3) providing developmentally appropriate books given at health supervision visits for all high-risk, low-income young children; (4) using a robust spectrum of options to support and promote these efforts; and (5) partnering with other child advocates to influence national messaging and policies that support and promote these key early shared-reading experiences. The AAP supports federal and state funding for children's books to be provided at pediatric health supervision visits to children at high risk living at or near the poverty threshold and the integration of literacy promotion, an essential component of pediatric primary care, into pediatric resident education. This policy statement is supported by the AAP technical report ``School Readiness'' and supports the AAP policy statement ``Early Childhood Adversity, Toxic Stress, and the Role of the Pediatrician: Translating Developmental Science Into Lifelong Health.''},

The tasks could be completed in a number of ways, including by matching quantitative relations, numerosity, or other aspects. Participants' matching strategies were analyzed with regard to the most mathematically advanced level utilized. There were substantial differences in participants' use of quantitative relations, numerosity and other aspects in their matching strategies. The results of this novel experimental setting show that investigating children's spontaneous recognition of quantitative relations provides novel insight into children's mathematical thinking and furthers the understanding of how children recognize and utilize mathematical aspects when not explicitly guided to do so. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

One hundred sixty-four Head Start children (44{\%} African American or Latino; 57{\%} female) were followed longitudinally. Path analyses revealed that working memory and attention control predicted growth in emergent literacy and numeracy skills during the pre-kindergarten year, and furthermore, that growth in these domain-general cognitive skills made unique contributions to the prediction of kindergarten math and reading achievement, controlling for growth in domain-specific skills. These findings extend research highlighting the importance of working memory and attention control for academic learning, demonstrating the effects in early childhood, prior to school entry. We discuss the implications of these findings for pre-kindergarten programs, particularly those designed to reduce the school readiness gaps associated with socio-economic disadvantage.},
	Annote = {Introduction

Documented and severe achievement gaps between middle-income and low-income children that expand and contribute to learning difficulties, educational attainment, and ultimate employment potential (Ryan, Fauth {\&} Brooks-Gunn, 2006)

What are the most effective strategies to reduce school readiness disparities? Should preschool programs focus on direct academic skill instruction (literacy, mathematics), as these are shown to be strong predictors of later success? Or should early educators focus on supporting the development of mental processes that underly effective approaches to learning, like working memory and attention control, which are both delayed in low-income children (Noble, McCandliss, {\&} Farah, 2007), and predict school adjustment and academic attainment (Blair {\&} Razza, 2007; Li-Grining, 2007; McClelland, Cameron, Connor, Farris, Jewkes, {\&} Morrison, 2007)?

Two central hypotheses: 

1) that growth in working memory and attention control would be associated concurrently with growth in emergent literacy and numeracy skills over the course of the pre-kindergarten year, and 

2) that growth of domain- general (working memory, attention control) and domain-specific (emergent literacy and numeracy) skills during the pre-kindergarten year would each make unique contributions to reading and math achievement in kindergarten

p. 2: executive function skills, particularly working memory and attention control, thus facilitate school readiness and early learning by supporting behavioral self-regulatory capacities and social competence (Blair, 2002; Hughes {\&} Ensor, 2007), and by fostering children's capacities to engage more effectively with teachers and peers in classroom learning activities (Hamre {\&} Pianta, 2005; Ladd, Birch, {\&} Buhs, 1999; Gathercole et al., 2008).

WORKING MEMORY
enables the retrieval of knowledge stored in long- term memory and its mental manipulation and application to foster the interpretation of novel information and the solution of problems

Evident relationship between working memory (WM) and both reading ability and math (addition, subtraction, word problems)

(Swanson et al, 2008; Swanson {\&} Jerman, 2007: WM supports development of problem-solving abilities, deficiencies underly reading disability

Passoulunghi et al (2006): working memory at school entry predictive of math task performance and later achievement

ATTENTION CONTROL
includes the capacity to focus and flexibly shift attention, as well as to ignore irrelevant stimuli and inhibit prepotent responding to stimuli, in order to respond to task demands (Blair {\&} Diamond, 2008)

Attention control associated with math and reading success

Method

Participants
164 children in their prekindergarten year in the control group of the Head Start REDI project (i.e., did not receive enhanced curriculum) 

Assessments 
Conducted at 3 time points
1) the beginning of the pre-kindergarten year, as soon as children had acclimated to the classroom setting, 
2) the end of the pre- kindergarten year, and 
3) the end of kindergarten.

Domain-specific Skills

Emergent Literacy Skills
Composite score derived from average of scores on 3 Measures, from the Test of Preschool Early Literacy (TOPEL)
Print Knowledge
identify and name letters or words
Blending
assessing phonological processing; combine parts of words ("b" and "air" to get "bear")
Elision
deconstruct compound words (point to picture corresponding to "snowshoe" without "snow")

Reading Achievement
Assessed at end of kindergarten year
Composite Score derived from scores on four measures:
1) Letter-Word Identification (from the Woodcock Johnson III: Test of Achievement)
decoding skills
2) Story Recall (from the Woodcock Johnson III: Test of Achievement)
memory for story content
3) Sight Word Efficiency from the Test of Word Reading Efficiency
speed identifying printed words 
4) Phonemic Decoding Efficiency (from the TOWRE)
speed accurately sounding out non-words

Emergent numeracy skills {\&} Math achievement
Assessment:
Applied Problems from the Woodcock -- Johnson III: Tests of Achievement
understanding of numbers and quantities (showing two fingers, counting objects, and adding or subtracting small numbers)

Domain-General Cognitive Abilities
Composite EF score derived from average of scores on three tasks:
1) Backward Word Span
assesses working memory: children are asked to repeat a list of words read aloud in reverse order

2) Peg Tapping 
assesses inhibitory attention control: children must tap a wooden dowel twice when the experimenter taps once, and to tap once when the experimenter taps twice, contrart to natural impulse to imitate

3) Dimensional Change Card Sort
assesses attention set-shifting abilities: children are taught to sort cards along one dimension, e.g., color, and then asked to sort the cards along the other dimension after 12 trials

Language skills covariate
Given that language skills will mediate any learning in preschool, a composite score derived from scores on three assessments:
1) Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test
vocabulary: asked to give one word to describe pictures
2) Grammatical Understanding (from the Test of Language Development -- Revised)
syntax comprehension: children hear a sentence and choose the picture that best matches it
3) Sentence Imitation (from the TOLDP:III)
syntax expression: children repeat increasingly complex sentences read by experimenter

Results
High correlations between all cognitive skill variables, and stability across the pre-K year

Pre-K literacy and mathematics skills significantly predict reading and math achievement, respectively

Pre-K working memory and attention control measures predicted kinder reading and math achievement

Initial levels of executive functions predicted growth in emergent literacy and numeracy skills between the beginning and end of the pre-kindergarten year, with initial levels of those skills (and initial levels of language skills) accounted for.

Growth in emergent literacy skills during Head Start predicted kindergarten reading achievement ($\beta$ = .25). Growth in EF had an additional, unique influence on kindergarten reading achievement

*a reciprocal relation also emerged, such that initial levels of emergent numeracy skills predicted growth in executive functions during the pre-kindergarten year ($\beta$ = .21), with initial levels of executive functions controlled

initial levels and growth of emergent numeracy skills made unique contributions to kinder math achievement, controlling for the effect of growth those skills during the pre-K period

growth in EF skills in pre-K made unique contributions to kinder math achievement

Conclusion
For reading and math, both domain-specific and domain-general cognitive skills made unique contributions to children's kindergarten reading achievement, suggesting that the "early development of working memory and attention control provide an important foundation for domain-specific academic learning." Given that early math ability is a reliable predictor of long-term academic achievement, the reciprocal relationship found between emergent math skills and EF skills is especially interesting. Pre-K math activities, in particulary, may place demands on working memory and attention control that relate to growth in those domain-general skills. Emergent literacy skills, on the other hand, were not predictive of domain-general EF skills, suggesting they represent, in the words of the authors, "acquired, acculturated knowledge, or crystallized abilities," unrelated to the growth of EF abilities. Finally and importantly, children growing up with socioeconomic disadvantage evidence delays in EF skill development. Developmental research suggests a relationship between those skills and aspects of the caretaking environment (sensitive-responsive caregiving, support for sustained joint attention, and effective scaffolding of early emotion regulation: Cicchetti, 2002; Goldsmith {\&} Rogoff, 1997; Lengua, Honorado {\&} Bush, 2007) that may be diminished in households affected by poverty. Extreme adversity and traumatic events are also, relatedly, associated with deficits in EF skills, (Cicchetti, 2002; O'Connor, Rutter, Beckett, et al., 2000).

Both teachers and students were asked to indicate their motivation in the program, and students were also asked to report the instructional support they received from their teachers. The results of hierarchical linear modeling analyses showed that teacher intrinsic motivation predicted student intrinsic motivation directly as well as indirectly through the mediation of instructional support. When teachers reported higher intrinsic motivation in the program, their students tended to perceive receiving more support from them and to report higher intrinsic motivation in the learning experience.},

	Abstract = {This study investigates the role of child-directed speech (CDS) in language acquisition by re-evaluating the old claim that mothers adapt their speech over the course of child language development. The specific hypothesis tested is that there may be quantal changes in certain properties of CDS such as speaking rate around the time children reach major linguistic milestones. The developmental path of CDS speaking rate was analyzed in 25 mother-child pairs from longitudinal corpora in CHILDES database (. MacWhinney, 2000). A parallel analysis was also made on the development of speaking rate in the child as well as the mean length of utterance (MLU) in mother and child. The total number of utterances analyzed approximates one million. The findings reveal that CDS speaking rate changes nonlinearly with a shift occurring early in the multiword stage. There is also some indication that another breakpoint might be present around the onset of child speech production. A parallel pattern of nonlinearity is also observed in the speaking rate of the child and the MLU of both mother and child. The results support the notion that CDS is adapted to the changing needs of the language-learning child, which could reflect its facilitative role in child language acquisition. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Using information theory, combined with estimates of the distribution of reflectances in the natural world and the reliability of lightness recall over time, we show that three lightness terms is the optimal number for describing surface reflectanceproperties inamodernurban or indoor environment.We also showthat only two lightness terms would be required in a forest or rural environment.},

	Abstract = {Words extracted from their original sentential contexts are often very hard to understand. Their intelligibility is modulated by the context from which they are taken. Curiously, the only study to use children as talkers in this paradigm found the reverse pattern---better intelligibility of words from predictive contexts. Exp 1, using 8 10-yr olds, showed that it only occurred when children were reading prepared materials; the "normal" adult-like pattern was found in the children's spontaneous conversation. Exp 2 demonstrated that adults can be induced to produce the "reverse" pattern, when they are placed in a challenging reading situation. Exp 3 showed that adults with high verbal skills produce the normal adult-like pattern when reading aloud, whereas adults with only average verbal skills do not. These results indicate that the traditional effect of redundancy can be found only when talkers have good control of the production situation. Children as young as 10 can compensate for contextual weakness through articulatory enhancement, but only in conversational situations that afford such control. Questions used to structure conversations with children, the 5 paragraphs read by children and adults, and sentence-frames for fill-in-the-blank judgments are appended.

	Abstract = {Are the forms of words systematically related to their meaning? The arbitrariness of the sign has long been a foundational part of our understanding of human language. Theories of communication predict a relationship between length and meaning, however: Longer descriptions should be more conceptually complex. Here we show that both the lexicons of human languages and individual speakers encode the relationship between linguistic and conceptual complexity. Experimentally, participants mapped longer words to more complex objects in comprehension and production tasks and across a range of stimuli. Explicit judgments of conceptual complexity were also highly correlated with implicit measures of study time in a memory task, suggesting that complexity is directly related to basic cognitive processes. Observationally, judgments of conceptual complexity for a sample of real words correlate highly with their length across 80 languages, even controlling for frequency, familiarity, imageability, and concreteness. While word lengths are systematically related to usage-both frequency and contextual predictability-our results reveal a systematic relationship with meaning as well. They point to a general regularity in the design of lexicons and suggest that pragmatic pressures may influence the structure of the lexicon.},

trade off between speaker and hearer pressures leads to a complexity bias at the pragmatic timescale and, over time, these pressures lead to the same regularity emerging in the lexicon over the language change timescale. Our data are not able to directly speak to the processes underlying participants' judg- ments---these judgments need not reflect in-the-moment prag- matic inference; they could also be the result of an iconic mapping between effort and meaning, or a lower-level statistical regularity extracted through extensive experience with a language. Regardless of the cognitive instantiation of this inference, the result is lexicons that reflect Horn's principle},

	Abstract = {A principle of efficient language production based on information theoretic considerations is proposed: Uniform Information Density predicts that language production is affected by a preference to distribute information uniformly across the linguistic signal. This prediction is tested against data from syntactic reduction. A single multilevel logit model analysis of naturally distributed data from a corpus of spontaneous speech is used to assess the effect of information density on complementizer that-mentioning, while simultaneously evaluating the predictions of several influential alternative accounts: availability, ambiguity avoidance, and dependency processing accounts. Information density emerges as an important predictor of speakers' preferences during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities, it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers' preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to the study of language production are discussed as well. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It seems probable that the conceptual developments of early Theory of Mind form an essential basis for helping to fix at least word reference. In development from two to four years, no basis exists in research for conclusions about the direction of influence between language and Theory of Mind. At the stage of false belief reasoning, after age four, the role of the mastery of syntactic complementation is highlighted as a representational tool, that is, language development assists reasoning. The paper presents a brief summary of Theory of Mind, ranging from its earliest beginnings in infancy to the appreciation around age four years that others might hold false beliefs and act according to them. For each development, the parallel language developments are described, and questions are raised about the interface between the two. In particular, research that might determine the direction of influence from one to the other is discussed. More work is called for, especially with nonverbal tasks, good experimental linguistic work, and other special populations, that might allow a more precise delineation of how language and Theory of Mind interrelate at the interface.},

Procedural knowledge is represented in units called production rules, and declarative knowledge is represented in units called chunks. The individual units are created by simple encodings of objects in the environment (chunks) or simple encodings of transformations in the environment (production rules). A great many such knowledge units underlie human cognition. From this large database, the appropriate units are selected for a particular context by activation processes that are tuned to the statistical structure of the environment. According to the ACT-R theory, the power of human cognition depends on the amount of knowledge encoded and the effective deployment of the encoded knowledge.},

	Abstract = {Because human languages vary in sound and meaning, children must learn which distinctions their language uses. For speech perception, this learning is selective: initially infants are sensitive to most acoustic distinctions used in any language, and this sensitivity reflects basic properties of the auditory system rather than mechanisms specific to language; however, infants' sensitivity to non-native sound distinctions declines over the course of the first year. Here we ask whether a similar process governs learning of word meanings. We investigated the sensitivity of 5-month-old infants in an English-speaking environment to a conceptual distinction that is marked in Korean but not English; that is, the distinction between 'tight' and 'loose' fit of one object to another. Like adult Korean speakers but unlike adult English speakers, these infants detected this distinction and divided a continuum of motion-into-contact actions into tight- and loose-fit categories. Infants' sensitivity to this distinction is linked to representations of object mechanics that are shared by non-human animals. Language learning therefore seems to develop by linking linguistic forms to universal, pre-existing representations of sound and meaning.},

Previous research has raised important questions regarding the usefulness of statistical learning in an environment filled with variability and noise, such as an infant's natural world. In an eye-tracking experiment, 8-month-old infants viewed sequences of spatio-temporal events with three different transitional probabilities (1.0-Deterministic, 0.75-High probability, and 0.5-Low probability). Across two between-subjects conditions, the sequences were presented with or without competing visual distracters. Results show that as transitional probability decreased, infants distributed less attention to the predictable locations and their anticipations were less often correct. With no distraction, infants had faster saccadic latencies to the high probability events; however, with distracters present in the stimulus environment, infants' eye movements shifted to favour the deterministic relations. These findings suggest that infants integrate multiple sources of variability to guide visual attention and facilitate the detection and learning of statistically reliable events.},

In Experiment 1, U.S. 2-year-olds (n = 77) showed more restricted exploration of a toy following a pedagogical demonstration than an interrupted, accidental, or no demonstration (baseline). In Experiment 2, Yucatec Mayan and U.S. 2-year-olds (n = 66) showed more restricted exploration following a pedagogical than an observational demonstration, while only Mayan children showed more restriction with age. These results suggest that although schooling is not a necessary precursor for sensitivity to pedagogy, early social experience may influence children's inferences and exploration in pedagogical contexts.},

	Abstract = {It is widely recognised that impaired social relations are characteristic of school-aged children with behavioural disorders, and predict a poor long-term outcome (Parker {\&} Asher, 1987). However, little is known about the early antecedents of social impairment in behaviourally disturbed children. The aim of the present study was to explore three areas of potential dysfunction in younger children: theory of mind, emotion understanding, and executive function. Forty preschoolers, rated by their parents on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1994) as "hard to manage" (H2M) were compared with a control group on a set of: (1) theory of mind tasks (including an emotion prediction task involving either a nice or a nasty surprise); (2) emotion understanding stories (that required affective perspective-taking skills as well as situational understanding); and (3) simple executive function tasks (adapted for preschoolers, and tapping inhibitory control, attentional set-shifting, and working memory). Small but significant group differences were found in all three cognitive domains. In particular, hard-to-manage preschoolers showed poor understanding of emotion and executive control, poor prediction or recall of a false belief, and better understanding of the belief-dependency of emotion in the context of a trick than a treat. Moreover, executive function was associated with performance on the theory of mind tasks for the hard-to-manage group alone, suggesting both direct and indirect links between executive dysfunction and disruptive behaviour.},

	Abstract = {A range of basic and applied studies have demonstrated that during the development of the auditory system, early experimental manipulations or clinical interventions are generally more effective than those made later. We present a short review of these studies. We investigated this age-related plasticity in relation to the timing of cochlear implantation in deaf-from-birth children. Cochlear implantation is a standard intervention for providing hearing in children with severe to profound deafness. An important practical question is whether there is a critical period or cutoff age of implantation after which hearing outcomes are significantly reduced. In this article, we present data from prelingually deaf children (mostly congenitally deaf) implanted at ages ranging from 1 to 15 years. Each child was tested with auditory and speech understanding tests before implantation, and at regular intervals up to 8 years postimplantation. We measured the improvement in performance of speech understanding tests in younger implanted children and compared it with the results of those implanted at a later age. We also used a binary partitioning algorithm to divide the data systematically at all ages at implant to determine the optimum split, i.e., to determine the age at implant which best separates performance of early implanted versus later implanted children. We observed distinct age-of-implant cutoffs, and will discuss whether these really represent critical periods during development.},

	Abstract = {The hypothesis that the associative learning-promoting effects of infant-directed speech (IDS) depend on infants' social experience was tested in a conditioned-attention paradigm with a cumulative sample of 4- to 14-month-old infants. Following six forward pairings of a brief IDS segment and a photographic slide of a smiling female face, infants of clinically depressed mothers exhibited evidence of having acquired significantly weaker voice-face associations than infants of non-depressed mothers. Regression analyses revealed that maternal depression was significantly related to infant learning even after demographic correlates of depression, antidepressant medication use, and extent of pitch modulation in maternal IDS had been taken into account. However, after maternal depression had been accounted for, maternal emotional availability, coded by blind raters from separate play interactions, accounted for significant further increments in the proportion of variance accounted for in infant learning scores. Both maternal depression and maternal insensitivity negatively, and additively, predicted poor learning.},

	Abstract = {How do children begin to use language to say things they have never heard before? The origins of linguistic productivity have been a subject of heated debate: While generativist accounts posit that childrens early language reflects the presence of syntactic abstractions, constructivist approaches instead emphasize gradual generalization over frequently-heard forms. Here we develop a Bayesian statistical model that measures the degree of abstraction implicit in childrens early use of the determiners ``a'' and ``the.'' Our work reveals that many previously-used corpora are too small to adjudicate between these theoretical positions. Several datasets, including the Speechome Corpus---a new ultra-dense dataset for one child---show evidence of low initial levels of productivity and higher levels later in development, however. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that children lack rich grammatical knowledge at the outset of language learning, but rapidly begin to generalize on the basis of structural regularities in their input.},

The present studies examined children's (N = 52 four- and five-year olds) explanations of social behavior to provide a window into their intuitive theories of how social categories constrain human action. Children systematically referenced category memberships and social relationships as causal-explanatory factors for specific types of social interactions: harm among members of different categories more than harm among members of the same category. In contrast, they systematically referred to agents' mental states to explain the reverse patterns of behaviors: harm among members of the same category more than harm among members of different categories. These data suggest that children view social category memberships as playing a causal-explanatory role in constraining social interactions.},

I shall argue that it is not enough to merely celebrate multilingualism or to use its existence to dismiss what cannot be dismissed or to shift attention from language to language institutions. Our commitment to multilingualism must lead us to combat the prediliction of the theoretician of form to parade distributional regularities as the picture of the undismissable and indispensible native speaker (cf. Coulmas, 1981). Fortunately, natural laboratories called multilingual contexts furnish abundant evidence for the construction of such a theory. They show that the routine abridgement of our linguistic competence is unwarranted but also that they have, as Haugen and others suggested in the past, important implications for the construction of monolingual grammars. The only option we have, I argue, is to refuse to renew the agreement we all signed almost a century ago and to work towards a new theory of linguistic form.},

	Abstract = {Every environment contains infinite potential features and correlations among features, or patterns. Detecting valid and learnable patterns in one environment is beneficial for learners because doing so lends predictability to new environments where the same or analogous patterns recur. However, some apparent correlations among features reflect spurious patterns, and attempting to learn the latter costs time and resources with no advantage to the learner. Thus, an efficient learner in a complex environment needs to devote more attention to input that reflects a real and learnable pattern than to input that reflects a spurious or ultimately unlearnable pattern. However, in order to achieve such efficiency in the absence of external feedback, learners need to have an implicit metric of their own learning progress. Do human infants have such a metric? Data from two experiments demonstrate that 17-month-olds attend longer to learnable vs. unlearnable linguistic grammars, taking more trials to habituate and more overall time to habituate for grammars in which a valid generalization over input stimuli can be made. These data provide the first evidence that infants have an implicit metric of their own learning progress and preferentially direct their attention to learnable aspects of their environment.},

Explicit metacognitive abilities of this sort are typically not attributed to children before the early school years (Cultice, Somerville {\&} Wellman, 1983; Flavell, Green {\&} Flavell, 2000; Lockl {\&} Schneider, 2002). However, recent data suggest that 3-year-olds have tacit access to their own knowledge states (Balcomb {\&} Gerken, 2008).


Schulz and Bonawitz 2007: explore toys that have ambiguous causality
habituation assumes ability to determine whether visual or auditory information already know or new


infants and young children differentially attend to already learned (or unambiguous) vs. unlearned (or ambiguous) domains


Test the hypothesis that infants have an implicit metric of their learning progress, which drives attention toward learnable and away from unlearnable linguistic patterns (i.e. grammars)


distinguish between learning that entails merely the encoding and recall of stimuli with the learning that is the focus of our research: A learnable problem is one that allows the learner to find deeper level patterns or generalizations in the stimuli themselves.


GENERALIZATION notion of learning
a learnable problem of the sort that we are studying here is one that allows data compression


a generalization = a data compression algorithm


a problem can be defined as learnable both objectively and subjectively


In the work presented here, we define a learnable problem as one that is both objectively and subjectively learnable.


(Can a problem be subjectively, but not objectively, learnable?)


an unlearnable problem can be either objectively unlearnable (the data are not com- pressible) or subjectively unlearnable (the data are compressible, but the learner is unable to determine how).


The question addressed in the current research is whether infants of the same age who are given the choice of how long to attend to input would differentiate a problem that they can solve from one they cannot, attending longer to input from the learnable pattern than to one that is either subjectively unlearnable (Experiment 1) or objectively unlearnable (Experiment 2).


Two dependent measures of listening time were used: the number of trials to habituate (Figure 1a) and the overall time to habituate (Fig- ure 1b).

Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional survey was to examine the coping strategies of two groups of Black women, those who work in non-professional service-related jobs and those employed as professionals. We explored Black women from two southern states, Florida and Georgia, in their use of coping strategies for everyday stressors. A modified version of Lazarus and Folkman's Transactional Model was used as the framework of this study. The sample for this cross-sectional survey consisted of 313 Black women employed in non-professional service jobs and 343 in professional roles. The thoughts and actions related to coping in everyday stressors were measured with The Ways of Coping Questionnaire. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {Despite the efficiency with which language users typically process spoken language, a growing body of research finds substantial individual differences in both the speed and accuracy of spoken language processing potentially attributable to participants' literacy skills. Against this background, the current study took a look at the role of word reading skill in listeners' anticipation of upcoming spoken language input in children at the cusp of learning to read; if reading skills affect predictive language processing, then children at this stage of literacy acquisition should be most susceptible to the effects of reading skills on spoken language processing. We tested 8-year-olds on their prediction of upcoming spoken language input in an eye-tracking task. Although children, like in previous studies to date, were successfully able to anticipate upcoming spoken language input, there was a strong positive correlation between children's word reading skills (but not their pseudo-word reading and meta-phonological awareness or their spoken word recognition skills) and their prediction skills. We suggest that these findings are most compatible with the notion that the process of learning orthographic representations during reading acquisition sharpens pre-existing lexical representations, which in turn also supports anticipation of upcoming spoken words.},

	Abstract = {Anthropomorphism, or the attribution of human properties to nonhuman entities, is often posited as an explanation for the origin and nature of God concepts, but it remains unclear which human properties we tend to attribute to God and under what conditions. In three studies, participants decided whether two types of human properties---psychological (mind-dependent) properties and physiological (body-dependent) properties---could or could not be attributed to God. In Study 1 (n = 1,525), participants made significantly more psychological attributions than physiological attributions, and the frequency of those attributions was correlated both with participants' religiosity and with their attribution of abstract, theological properties. In Study 2 (n = 99) and Study 3 (n = 138), participants not only showed the same preference for psychological properties but were also significantly faster, more consistent, and more confident when attributing psychological properties to God than when attributing physiological properties. And when denying properties to God, they showed the reverse pattern---that is, they were slower, less consistent, and less confident when denying psychological properties than when denying physiological properties. These patterns were observed both in a predominantly Christian population (Study 2) and a predominantly Hindu population (Study 3). Overall, we argue that God is conceptualized not as a person in general but as an agent in particular, attributed a mind by default but attributed a body only upon further consideration.},

	Abstract = {Children may learn new words better from child-directed speech early on in life in part because it is less complex, which serves to maintain their attention, a necessary precursor to learning. Previous work has suggested that speech to children contains more words they are likely to know than does speech between adults. In this study, we take advantage of longitudinal corpora spanning approximately one year in the development of 12 children, a corpus of diverse, informal adult conversations, and independent ratings of semantic variables to explore a) qualitative changes in speech to children as they mature, b) systematic differences from speech to adults, and c) qualitative variation among adult speakers to both audiences. We find that words in speech to children are reliably more concrete than words in speech to adults, and that child-directed speech becomes less concrete with the age of the child between 20 and 36 months. The same is not true for the valence, or positivity, of words. Regardless of whether caregivers are intentionally scaffolding children's learning or simply trying to communicate effectively, this difference between concrete-ness and valence is consistent with caregivers being sensitive to children's language development, as concrete words are by definition easier to learn without the aid of other language.},

	Abstract = {This paper suggests that there are constraints on learning required to explain the acquisition of language, in particular. maturational constraints. First. empirical evidence for this claim is reviewed. The evidence from several studies of both first and second language acquisition suggests that normal language learning occurs only when exposure to the language begins early in life. With exposure beginning later in life. asymptotic performance in the language declines: the effects over age of first exposure are approximately linear through childhood. with a flattening of the function in adulthood. These outcomes argue that some type of constraints ensuring successful language learning exist early in life, and weaken with increasing maturation. Second. two hypotheses are considered as to the nature of these maturational changes. One hypothesis is that constraints on learning particular to language acquisition undergo maturational decay. A second hypothesis. which is considered in more detail. suggests that language leaming abilities decline because of the expansion of nonlinguistic cognitive abilities. ?? 1990.},

Many areas of psychology, from cognitive, developmental, social, to clinical, are interested in how individuals make inferences and decisions with incomplete information. The ability to reason under uncertainty necessarily involves probability computations, be they exact calculations or estimations. What are the developmental origins of probabilistic reasoning? Recent work has begun to examine whether infants and toddlers can compute probabilities; however, previous experiments have confounded quantity and probability-in most cases young human learners could have relied on simple comparisons of absolute quantities, as opposed to proportions, to succeed in these tasks. We present four experiments providing evidence that infants younger than 12. months show sensitivity to probabilities based on proportions. Furthermore, infants use this sensitivity to make predictions and fulfill their own desires, providing the first demonstration that even preverbal learners use probabilistic information to navigate the world. These results provide strong evidence for a rich quantitative and statistical reasoning system in infants. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments were employed to investigate the processing speed of a visual target surrounded by visual noise (e.g., HHSHH or SSSSS) and auditory location cues (e.g., {\&} left- or right-positioned tone) in a binary choice reaction time (RT) task. Visual noise impaired processing speed when it was incongruent with the target (e.g., HHSHH and SSHSS). Irrelevant location cues impaired reaction speed when the location of the tone did not correspond with the location of the correct response. When the visual stimuli were characters, the visual and auditory noise sources made additive contributions to mean visual choice RT. It was concluded therefore that visual congruity and location correspondence affect different process elements, response activation and response selection, respectively. This conclusion must be qualified, however, in that when the visual stimuli were left- or right-pointing arrows (e.g., ←←←←← or ←←→←←), congruity and correspondence interacted. This interaction is interpreted to suggest that when visual and auditory noise are the same type (i.e., eliciting a left or right association) a cross talk between visual and auditory feature-detection channels might occur to produce a perceptual conflict on corresponding trials. {\textcopyright} 1988 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

	Abstract = {This study investigates the role of child-directed speech (CDS) in language acquisition by re-evaluating the old claim that mothers adapt their speech over the course of child language development. The specific hypothesis tested is that there may be quantal changes in certain properties of CDS such as speaking rate around the time children reach major linguistic milestones. The developmental path of CDS speaking rate was analyzed in 25 mother-child pairs from longitudinal corpora in CHILDES database (. MacWhinney, 2000). A parallel analysis was also made on the development of speaking rate in the child as well as the mean length of utterance (MLU) in mother and child. The total number of utterances analyzed approximates one million. The findings reveal that CDS speaking rate changes nonlinearly with a shift occurring early in the multiword stage. There is also some indication that another breakpoint might be present around the onset of child speech production. A parallel pattern of nonlinearity is also observed in the speaking rate of the child and the MLU of both mother and child.

	Abstract = {The present study attempts to determine at the experiential level the number and nature of dimensions of response to humor. A sample of 50 male and 50 female adults judged 24 jokes and cartoons on 17 seven-point rating scales. The set of ratings was empirically selected from spontaneous responses of subjects to a set of humor Stimuli and represents a variety of aspects of reactions to humor. Positive and negative responses were recorded, as were judgments about perceived Stimulus properties and subjects' own feeling state. Factor analyses of the intercorrelations among the response scales yielded one positive response factor ("exhilaration") and two negative response factors ( "indignation" and "boredom"). In all three factor s f the distinction between evaluation of Stimulus properties and one's feeling state turned out not to be of importance. The high loadings of the Stimulus ratings funny and witty, and of the feeling ratings exhilarated and amused, on a single factor representing all positive responses to humor are interpreted as supporting the view of the emotion of exhilaration advanced by Ruch (1990). Conservatism correlated positively with indicators of exhilaration and negatively with indicators of boredom in response to incongruity- resolution humor. Conservatism also correlated positively with indicators of indignation in response to sexual humor. The use of marker variables for all three response dimensions is recommended for future humor studies. It is suggested that supporting evidence for the negative response dimensions from the study of facial expressions in response to humor is necessary.},

In these experiments, 6- and 9-year-olds and adults were asked to formulate interpretations of similar and dissimilar conceptual combinations. Both children and adults were sensitive to the similarity aspect of conceptual combinations, although the children had some difficulty with the property interpretations that high-similarity combinations require. Next, we examined 40 popular children's books for the presence of noun-noun conceptual combinations. Adult participants provided interpretations for these combinations and rated the similarity of the head and modifier nouns. Results indicated that there were few high-similarity combinations and few combinations requiring property interpretations, suggesting that children have limited exposure to highly similar combinations and property interpretations. Further analysis of children's interpretations indicates that they may have difficulty in selecting and integrating properties of the modifier onto the head, a process required by property interpretations.},

Experiment 1 used a microgenetic design to examine the effects on learning of the type of counting procedure that children use. As predicted, having kindergartners count-on from their current number on the board while playing a 0-100 number board game facilitated their encoding of the numerical-spatial relations on the game board and improved their number line estimates, numeral identification, and count-on skill. Playing the same game using the standard count-from-1 procedure led to considerably less learning. Experiment 2 demonstrated that comparable improvement in number line estimation does not occur with practice encoding the numerals 1-100 outside of the context of a number board game.

The analyses confirm that the CSRP improved low-income children's self-regulation skills (as indexed by attention/impulse control and executive function) from fall to spring of the Head Start year. Analyses also suggest significant benefits of CSRP for children's preacademic skills, as measured by vocabulary, letter-naming, and math skills. Partial support was found for improvement in children's self-regulation as a hypothesized mediator for children's gains in academic readiness.

@article{Waxman2000,
	Abstract = {Previous research has documented that basic-level object categories provide an initial foundation for mapping adjectives to object properties. Children ranging from 21 months to 3 years can successfully extend a novel adjective (e.g., transparent) to other objects sharing a salient property if the objects are all members of the same basic-level category; if the objects are members of different basic-level categories, they fail to extend adjectives systematically (R. S. Klibanoff {\&} S. R. Waxman, 2000a; S. R. Waxman {\&} D. B. Markow, 1998). The present study proposed that the process of comparison is instrumental in children's ability to move beyond this foundation. To promote comparison, 2 target objects were introduced to 3-year-olds. In Experiment 1, the targets had contrastive properties (e.g., 1 transparent and 1 opaque object); in Experiment 2, the targets had consistent properties (e.g., 2 transparent objects). The results of both experiments illustrate that comparison---a general psychological process---operates in conjunction with naming to support the extension of novel adjectives to properties of objects from diverse basic-level categories.},

	Abstract = {Adult humans recognize that even unfamiliar speech can communicate information between third parties, demonstrating an ability to separate communicative function from linguistic content. We examined whether 12-month-old infants understand that speech can communicate before they understand the meanings of specific words. Specifically, we test the understanding that speech permits the transfer of information about a Communicator's target object to a Recipient. Initially, the Communicator selectively grasped one of two objects. In test, the Communicator could no longer reach the objects. She then turned to the Recipient and produced speech (a nonsense word) or non-speech (coughing). Infants looked longer when the Recipient selected the non-target than the target object when the Communicator had produced speech but not coughing (Experiment 1). Looking time patterns differed from the speech condition when the Recipient rather than the Communicator produced the speech (Experiment 2), and when the Communicator produced a positive emotional vocalization (Experiment 3), but did not differ when the Recipient had previously received information about the target by watching the Communicator's selective grasping (Experiment 4). Thus infants understand the information-transferring properties of speech and recognize some of the conditions under which others' information states can be updated. These results suggest that infants possess an abstract understanding of the communicative function of speech, providing an important potential mechanism for language and knowledge acquisition. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this article, we review a burgeoning empirical literature on this model, drawing on both cross-sectional and prospective studies. As evidence has emerged for this model, we argue that it is time to consider more specific aspects of BAS sensitivity in this disorder. We review evidence that bipolar disorder relates to an increased willingness to expend effort toward reward and to increases in energy and goal pursuit after an initial reward. We conclude by considering the strengths and weaknesses of this literature, with an eye toward future directions and implications for treatment.},

Nevertheless, social categorization often has nefarious consequences. We suggest that the foundation of the human ability to form useful social categories is in place in infancy: social categories guide the inferences infants make about the shared characteristics and social relationships of other people. We also suggest that the ability to form abstract social categories may be separable from the eventual negative downstream consequences of social categorization, including prejudice, discrimination, and stereotyping. Although a tendency to form inductively-rich social categories appears early in ontogeny, prejudice based on each particular category dimension may not be inevitable.},

	Abstract = {Details of the linguistic modifications in speech to children are provided for the Mayan language Quich{\'{e}}. Quich{\'{e}} input is evaluated with respect to 17 features listed in Ferguson (1978). Eight additional features are noted for Quich{\'{e}} speech to children: whispering, initial-syllable deletion, BT forms for verbs, a verbal suffix that appears exclusively in speech to children, a relatively fixed word order with relatively fewer overt noun phrases, more imperatives, and a special interpretive routine. Quich{\'{e}} parents have a special register for speaking to young children. However, Quich{\'{e}} speech to children has only five of the features that Ferguson cites: repetition, BT forms for qualities, compound verbs, diminutives, and special sounds. This suggests that the features of speech to children are not universal, but are determined by the conventions for interacting with children in each community. Functional explanations of such features will have to take this degree of cultural variation into consideration.},

	Abstract = {Young children's language experiences and language outcomes are highly variable. Research in recent decades has focused on understanding the extent to which family socioeconomic status (SES) relates to parents' language input to their children and, subsequently, children's language learning. Here, we first review research demonstrating differences in the quantity and quality of language that children hear across low-, mid-, and high-SES groups, but also-and perhaps more importantly-research showing that differences in input and learning also exist within SES groups. Second, in order to better understand the defining features of 'high-quality' input, we highlight findings from laboratory studies examining specific characteristics of the sounds, words, sentences, and social contexts of child-directed speech (CDS) that influence children's learning. Finally, after narrowing in on these particular features of CDS, we broaden our discussion by considering family and community factors that may constrain parents' ability to participate in high-quality interactions with their young children. A unification of research on SES and CDS will facilitate a more complete understanding of the specific means by which input shapes learning, as well as generate ideas for crafting policies and programs designed to promote children's language outcomes.

@article{Kempe2009,
	Abstract = {This study explores how 2D:4D digit ratio, Empathising Quotient (EQ), and child-related attitudes are linked to prosodic characteristics of child-directed speech (CDS) in childless adolescents. Pitch, pitch range, and phoneme durations were measured in 44 females and 45 males addressing an adult and a 4-5 months old infant. The results showed that CDS increases in pitch and pitch range were similar in males and females while phoneme lengthening, particularly fricative lengthening, was higher in females, which may point to a greater propensity to adopt a soothing intonation. Moreover, in females, higher EQ was associated with an anticipatory raise in pitch suggesting greater sensitivity to the presence of an infant even outside of child-directed interactions. In males, child-related attitude was a good predictor of prosodic adjustment in CDS while higher EQ and higher left hand digit ratio were associated with an attenuation of CDS prosody. These findings suggest that in young men, greater social awareness is linked to avoidance of potentially embarrassing prosodic features while greater prenatal testosterone exposure is linked to more normative child-related behaviours. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

If a person has referred to an object with a certain term (e.g., the horse), will children expect this person to use this term in the future but allow others to use a different expression (e.g., the pony)? One hundred twenty-eight children between 3 and 5 years old co-operated with an experimenter (E1) to move toys to new locations on a shelf. E1 established referential terms for all toys in a warm-up game. Then, either the original partner, E1, or a new partner, E2, played a second game with the same toys. In this game, the experimenters referred to toys using either their original terms from the warm-up game or new terms. Children were slower to react to new terms than old, and this difference in reaction times was greater in the original partner condition (but only on the first trial). Children sometimes protested at the use of new terms, doing so regardless of their interlocutor's identity. We contrast these findings with those for adults and discuss their implications for the debate regarding the nature of referential pacts.},

	Abstract = {The present study investigated whether lexical frequency, a variable that is known to affect the time taken to utter a verbal response, may also influence articulation. Pairs of words that differed in terms of their relative frequency, but were matched on their onset, vowel, and number of phonemes (e.g., map vs. mat, where the former is more frequent than the latter) were used in a picture naming and a reading aloud task. Low-frequency items yielded slower response latencies than high-frequency items in both tasks, with the frequency effect being significantly larger in picture naming compared to reading aloud. Also, initial-phoneme durations were longer for low-frequency items than for high-frequency items. The frequency effect on initial-phoneme durations was slightly more prominent in picture naming than in reading aloud, yet its size was very small, thus preventing us from concluding that lexical frequency exerts an influence on articulation. Additionally, initial-phoneme and whole-word durations were significantly longer in reading aloud compared to picture naming. We discuss our findings in the context of current theories of reading aloud and speech production, and the approaches they adopt in relation to the nature of information flow (staged vs. cascaded) between cognitive and articulatory levels of processing.},
	Annote = {(1) (As you might do for all studies you come across!), write down the research question, its answer, a brief summary of the findings supporting that answer, and one or two implications of Mousikou {\&} Rastle's (2015) study.
(2) Explain what the terms ``staged'', ``serial'', ``interactive'', and ``cascading'' mean in the context of models of word production. Your definition should make it clear which of these (if any) are mutually exclusive properties of a model, and which are mutually compatible.
Be concise. One or two paragraphs should suffice.
(3) State the relevance of spoken word durations for staged vs. cascaded models of word production.

Mousikou {\&} Rastle (2015) asked whether a lexical variable like frequency may affect articulation. Specifically, they looked at initial-phoneme durations in pairs of words matched on number of phonemes and onset and vowel, but differing in their frequency. Lists comprised of the low-frequency members of the pairs and high-frequency members of the pairs also differed in mean AoA but were matched on other linguistic variables. The authors compared initial phoneme durations between the same low- and high-frequency word lists in two tasks: picture naming and reading aloud. The authors analyzed reaction times and initial-phoneme durations between frequency types in the two tasks, as well as whole-word durations between the two task types. In both the picture naming and reading aloud tasks, reaction times were longer for low frequency words, and in the picture naming task more generally. Initial-phoneme durations were longer in the reading aloud task overall, as well as for low-frequency words only in the picture-naming task. The authors take their findings as providing suggestive, but not definitive, evidence for the influence of lexical frequency on articulation, as they would have expected to see a significant and greater difference in initial-phoneme durations between high- and low-frequency words in both tasks. Their findings suggest that the relationship between higher-level cognitive processing and lower-level articulatory processing is not staged.  
`Staged' and `serial' are synonymous as I understand them (and certainly mutually compatible). They are mutually exclusive with `interactive' and `cascading.' In the context of models of word production, the former two terms imply that articulatory processes can only take place after cognitive processing is completed. Higher-level cognitive processes and lower-level articulatory processes are therefore independent. In contrast, in interactive or cascading models, the two levels of processes may overlap. For example, articulatory processing and the initiation of the verbal response may be already underway before the completion of cognitive processing.
Spoken word durations, if different for otherwise identical lexemes on the basis of a lexical variable like frequency, imply that word production is not staged. Any cognitive processes involved in selecting an abstract phonological code for production should have no effect on characteristics of the articulated word like phoneme duration.},

@article{Christiansen2008,
	Abstract = {It is widely assumed that human learning and the structure of human languages are intimately related. This relationship is frequently suggested to derive from a language-specific biological endowment, which encodes universal, but communicatively arbitrary, principles of language structure (a Universal Grammar or UG). How might such a UG have evolved? We argue that UG could not have arisen either by biological adaptation or non-adaptationist genetic processes, resulting in a logical problem of language evolution. Specifically, as the processes of language change are much more rapid than processes of genetic change, language constitutes a "moving target" both over time and across different human populations, and, hence, cannot provide a stable environment to which language genes could have adapted. We conclude that a biologically determined UG is not evolutionarily viable. Instead, the original motivation for UG--the mesh between learners and languages--arises because language has been shaped to fit the human brain, rather than vice versa. Following Darwin, we view language itself as a complex and interdependent "organism," which evolves under selectional pressures from human learning and processing mechanisms. That is, languages themselves are shaped by severe selectional pressure from each generation of language users and learners. This suggests that apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics.},

	Abstract = {Speech rhythm has long been claimed to be a useful bootstrapping cue in the very first steps of language acquisition. Previous studies have suggested that newborn infants do categorize varieties of speech rhythm, as demonstrated by their ability to discriminate between certain languages. However, the existing evidence is not unequivocal: in previous studies, stimuli discriminated by newborns always contained additional speech cues on top of rhythm. Here, we conducted a series of experiments assessing discrimination between Dutch and Japanese by newborn infants, using a speech resynthesis technique to progressively degrade non-rhythmical properties of the sentences. When the stimuli are resynthesized using identical phonemes and artificial intonation contours for the two languages, thereby preserving only their rhythmic and broad phonotactic structure, newborns still seem to be able to discriminate between the two languages, but the effect is weaker than when intonation is present. This leaves open the possibility that the temporal correlation between intonational and rhythmic cues might actually facilitate the processing of speech rhythm. Key-words:},

	Abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {We examine the question of which aspects of language are uniquely human and uniquely linguistic in light of recent suggestions by Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch that the only such aspect is syntactic recursion, the rest of language being either specific to humans but not to language (e.g. words and concepts) or not specific to humans (e.g. speech perception). We find the hypothesis problematic. It ignores the many aspects of grammar that are not recursive, such as phonology, morphology, case, agreement, and many properties of words. It is inconsistent with the anatomy and neural control of the human vocal tract. And it is weakened by experiments suggesting that speech perception cannot be reduced to primate audition, that word learning cannot be reduced to fact learning, and that at least one gene involved in speech and language was evolutionarily selected in the human lineage but is not specific to recursion. The recursion-only claim, we suggest, is motivated by Chomsky's recent approach to syntax, the Minimalist Program, which de-emphasizes the same aspects of language. The approach, however, is sufficiently problematic that it cannot be used to support claims about evolution. We contest related arguments that language is not an adaptation, namely that it is "perfect," non-redundant, unusable in any partial form, and badly designed for communication. The hypothesis that language is a complex adaptation for communication which evolved piecemeal avoids all these problems.},
	Annote = {Response to Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002)

p. 203: In a recent article in Science, Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002) offer a hypothesis about what is special about language, with reflections on its evolutionary genesis. The article (henceforth HCF) has attracted much attention both in the popular press (Kenneally, 2003; Wade, 2003) and among other language scientists. HCF differentiate (as we do) between aspects of language that are special to language (the ``Narrow Language Faculty'' or FLN) and the faculty of language in its entirety, including parts that are shared with other psychological abilities (the ``Broad Language Faculty'' or FLB). The abstract of HCF makes the very strong proposal that the narrow language faculty ``only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language.''

1. The issue of what is special to language

HCF paper major recantation compared to prev Chomsky view

In this paper we analyze HCF's recursion-only hypothesis, and conclude that it is hard
to sustain. We will show that there is considerably more of language that is special, though still, we think, a plausible product of the processes of evolution.

2. What's special: a brief examination of the evidence.
2.1. Conceptual structure
The primate literature, incisively analyzed in HCF, gives us good reason to believe that some of the foundations of the human conceptual system are present in other primates, such as the major subsystems dealing with spatial, causal, and social reasoning.

2.2. Speech perception
HCF go further and suggest that there have been no evolutionary changes to the mammalian auditory system for the function of speech perception in humans. They suggest that this null hypothesis has withstood all attempts to reject it. We are not so sure
Not surprising some animals can discriminate sound pairs 
Humans much more complicated - continuous, information-rich, and variable

if findings of similarities between humans and animals trained on human speech contrasts are taken as evidence that primate audition is a sufficient basis for human speech perception, findings of differences following such training must be taken as weakening such a conclusion.

† Conceptual structure: HCF plausibly suggest that human conceptual structure partly overlaps with that of other primates and partly incorporates newly evolved capacities.
† Speech perception. HCF suggest it is simply generic primate auditory perception. But the tasks given to monkeys are not comparable to the feats of human speech perception,
and most of Liberman's evidence for the Speech-is-Special hypothesis, and more recent experimental demonstrations of human--monkey differences in speech perception, are not discussed.
† Speech production. HCF's recursion-only hypothesis implies no selection for speech production in the human lineage. But control of the supralaryngeal vocal
tract is incomparably more complex in human language than in other primate vocalizations. Vocal imitation and vocal learning are uniquely human among primates (talents that are consistently manifested only in speech). And syllabic babbling emerges spontaneously in human infants. HCF further suggest that the distinctively human anatomy of the vocal tract may have been selected for size exaggeration rather than speech. Yet the evidence for the former in humans is weak, and does not account for the distinctive anatomy of the supralaryngeal parts of the vocal tract.
† Phonology. Not discussed by HCF.
† Lexicon. HCF discuss two ways in which words are a distinctively human ability, possibly unique to our species. But they assign words to the broad language faculty, which is shared by other human cognitive faculties, without discussing the ways in which words appear to be tailored to language---namely that they consist in part (sometimes in large part) of grammatical information, and that they are bidirectional, shared, organized, and generic in reference, features that are experimentally demonstrable in young children's learning of words.
† Morphology: Not discussed by HCF.
† Syntax: Case, agreement, pronouns, predicate-argument structure, topic, focus, auxiliaries, question markers, and so on, are not discussed by HCF. Recursion is said to be human-specific, but no distinction is made between arbitrary recursive mathematical systems and the particular kinds of recursive phrase structure found in human languages.

1950s-era formulations and from long-criticized 1970s-era rivals must be rehabilitated

Indeed, if language were not designed for communication, the key tenet of
Minimalism---that language consists of a mapping from meaning to sound---would not be a ``virtual conceptual necessity,'' as Chomsky has repeatedly asserted, but an inexplicable coincidence. The only way to make sense of the fact that humans are equipped with a way to map between meaning and vocally produced sound is that it allows one person to get a meaning into a second person's head by making a sound with his or her vocal tract},

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	Abstract = {Past research finds that monolingual and bilingual children prefer native speakers to individuals who speak in unfamiliar foreign languages or accents. Do children in bilingual contexts socially distinguish among familiar languages and accents and, if so, how do their social preferences based on language and accent compare? The current experiments tested whether 5- to 7-year-olds in two bilingual contexts in the United States demonstrate social preferences among the languages and accents that are present in their social environments. We compared children's preferences based on language (i.e., English vs. their other native language) and their preferences based on accent (i.e., English with a native accent vs. English with a non-native [yet familiar] accent). In Experiment 1, children attending a French immersion school demonstrated no preference between English and French speakers but preferred American-accented English to French-accented English. In Experiment 2, bilingual Korean American children demonstrated no preference between English and Korean speakers but preferred American-accented English to Korean-accented English. Across studies, bilingual children's preferences based on accent (i.e., American-accented English over French- or Korean-accented English) were not related to their own language dominance. These results suggest that children from diverse linguistic backgrounds demonstrate social preferences for native-accented speakers. Implications for understanding the potential relation between social reasoning and language acquisition are discussed.},

Samples of the mothers' adult-directed speech also were collected. There were significant social class differences in the mothers' child- directed speech and some parallel social class differences in the mothers' adult-directed speech. These findings suggested that some social class differences in child-directed speech may be instances of more general class differences in language use. There also were main effects of communicative setting on mothers' child-directed speech and interaction effects in which setting moderated the size of the class differences in maternal speech. These findings suggested that the amount of time mothers spend interacting with their children in different contexts may be at least as important an influence on children's linguistic experience as are average characteristics of their mothers' speech},

	Abstract = {Adults can incrementally combine information from speech with astonishing speed to anticipate future words. Concurrently, a growing body of work suggests that vocabulary ability is crucially related to lexical processing skills in children. However, little is known about this relationship with predictive sentence processing in children or adults. We explore this question by comparing the degree to which an upcoming sentential theme is anticipated by combining information from a prior agent and action. 48 children, aged of 3 to 10, and 48 college-aged adults' eye-movements were recorded as they heard a sentence (e.g., The pirate hides the treasure) in which the object referred to one of four images that included an agent-related, action-related and unrelated distractor image. Pictures were rotated so that, across all versions of the study, each picture appeared in all conditions, yielding a completely balanced within-subjects design. Adults and children quickly made use of combinatory information available at the action to generate anticipatory looks to the target object. Speed of anticipatory fixations did not vary with age. When controlling for age, individuals with higher vocabularies were faster to look to the target than those with lower vocabulary scores. Together, these results support and extend current views of incremental processing in which adults and children make use of linguistic information to continuously update their mental representation of ongoing language. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

We found that 11-month-old infants (N = 110) used violations of prior expectations as special opportunities for learning. The infants were shown events that violated expectations about object behavior or events that were nearly identical but did not violate expectations. The sight of an object that violated expectations enhanced learning and promoted information-seeking behaviors; specifically, infants learned more effectively about objects that committed violations, explored those objects more, and engaged in hypothesis-testing behaviors that reflected the particular kind of violation seen. Thus, early in life, expectancy violations offer a wedge into the problem of what to learn.},

Four experiments demonstrate that verbally framing an event (?Which animals make Lion laugh??) helps 4-year-olds extract evidence from a complex scene to make accurate causal inferences. Whereas framing was unnecessary when evidence was isolated, children required it to extract and reason about evidence embedded in a more complex scene. Subtler framing stating the causal problem, but not highlighting the relevant variables, was equally effective. Simply making the causal relationship more perceptually obvious did facilitate children's inferences, but not to the level of verbal framing. These results illustrate how children's causal reasoning relies on scaffolding from adults.},

	Abstract = {Pregnant women recited a short child's rhyme, "the target", aloud each day between the thirty third and thirty seventh weeks of their fetuses' gestation. Then their fetuses were stimulated with tape recordings of the target and a control rhyme. The target elicited a decrease in fetal heartrate whereas the control did not. Thus, fetuses' exposure to specific speech sounds can affect their subsequent reactions to those sounds. More generally, the result suggests that third trimester fetuses become familiar with recurrent, maternal speech sounds. ?? 1994.},

	Abstract = {Infants begin to segment novel words from speech by 7.5 months, demonstrating an ability to track, encode and retrieve words in the context of larger units. Although it is presumed that word recognition at this stage is a prerequisite to constructing a vocabulary, the continuity between these stages of development has not yet been empirically demonstrated. The goal of the present study is to investigate whether infant word segmentation skills are indeed related to later lexical development. Two word segmentation tasks, varying in complexity, were administered in infancy and related to childhood outcome measures. Outcome measures consisted of age-normed productive vocabulary percentiles and a measure of cognitive development. Results demonstrated a strong degree of association between infant word segmentation abilities at 7 months and productive vocabulary size at 24 months. In addition, outcome groups, as defined by median vocabulary size and growth trajectories at 24 months, showed distinct word segmentation abilities as infants. These findings provide the first prospective evidence supporting the predictive validity of infant word segmentation tasks and suggest that they are indeed associated with mature word knowledge.

	Abstract = {A category can be representad as aprobability density function (pdf), that is, a as a set of exemplars along with the probability or likelihood that each is selected as stimulus. This article examines the relation between categorization and pdf estimation. We first discuss the differences between classifiers that know the true category pdfs and classifiers that smus estimate these functions from trial-by-trial feedback. Consistency is shown to be the key statistical property that guarantees two such classifiers will reasonably agree. Parametric and nonparamteric pdf estimators are interpreted from the perspective of the categorization process. It is shown that the prototype model and several decision-bound models of categorization are parametric, wheras most exemplar models are nonparametric. The exemplar models are shown to be equivalent to a classifier that uses the minimum variance unbiased estimator of the category baserates and a nonparametric pdf estimator that is one of the most commonly used estimators of professional statisticians (i.e., the kernel estimator). It is also shown that in most applications, the exemplar models predict essentially optimal performance. Finally, the implications of these results are discussed and an alternative approach to the study of categorization is suggested.},

The program offers a combination of tailored rehabilitation, training, and job practice, and a generous, stable, and non-means-tested benefit. Its primary aims are to mitigate poverty and subsequently promote self-supporting employment. Our evaluation strategy exploits a geographically staggered program introduction, and the causal effects are identified on the basis of changes in employment prospects that coincide with local program implementation in a way that correlates with the predicted probability of becoming a participant. We find that the program raised employment prospects considerably. (JEL H55, I32, I38, J24)},

Although much of this evidence proves correlational, they point to a series of recent intervention studies that offer evidence of a key variable linking play and language: adult support. In particular, guided play during which adults scaffold child-initiated learning seems ideal for developing language skills. Based on this evidence, they argue that understanding the efficacy of play for learning requires paying careful attention to the type of play involved and to its results.},

Four studies explored whether 2- (N=48) and 3-year-olds (N=32) demonstrate this same capacity when learning by eavesdropping. After surreptitiously observing an adult use 1 of 2 artifacts to operate a bell via a monitor, 3-year-olds returned to the demonstrated kind of tool as "for" the task and avoided it for an alternative task over 2 days. Two-year-olds performed similarly after eavesdropping on someone with more discriminable artifacts via the method of a window rather than a monitor. These results demonstrate that toddlers can acquire enduring artifact categories after less than 40 s of surreptitious observation.},

	Abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

The current study examines accuracy and bias in one type of perspective-taking: inferences about what others know. Twenty-two New York City landmarks were presented in three conditions: Picture Only, Picture-+ Name and Name Only. Subjects estimated the proportion of short- and long-term New York City residents who could identify each landmark from its picture. They also rated their subjective recognition of the stimuli. Subjects in all three conditions were good at estimating stimulus identifiability, but their estimates were biased in the direction of their own knowledge. Estimates of the difference in identifications by short-and long-term residents were relatively inaccurate, probably because the two groups differed less than anticipated. For most but not all subjects, subjective feelings of recognition were significantly correlated with estimates of identifiability. We conclude that perceptions of the distribution of knowledge are socially shared.},

However, complex arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, using symbols and/or labeling have only been demonstrated in a limited number of nonhuman vertebrates. We show that honeybees, with a miniature brain, can learn to use blue and yellow as symbolic representations for addition or subtraction. In a free-flying environment, individual bees used this information to solve unfamiliar problems involving adding or subtracting one element from a group of elements. This display of numerosity requires bees to acquire long-term rules and use short-term working memory. Given that honeybees and humans are separated by over 400 million years of evolution, our findings suggest that advanced numerical cognition may be more accessible to nonhuman animals than previously suspected.},

We present a model that captures pedagogical assumptions (adapted from Shafto and Goodman, 2008) and test the model with a novel experiment looking at 4-year-olds' exploratory play in pedagogical and non-pedagogical contexts. Our findings are consistent with the model predictions: preschool children limit their exploration in pedagogical contexts, spending most of their free play performing only the demonstrated action. By contrast, children explore broadly both at baseline and after an accidental demonstration. Thus pedagogy constrains children's exploration for better and for worse; children learn the demonstrated causal relationship but are less likely than children in non-pedagogical contexts to discover and learn other causal relationships.},

The present study tested whether children's approach to this task systematically shifts as they develop causal understandings of the mechanisms that shape individual action. 3- and 4-year-old children (N = 65) predicted harmful behaviors in scenarios that pitted category-based expectations---that individuals will harm members of opposing social categories---against expectations about agents' mental states---that individuals will harm people they are mad at. As children developed more advanced theories of mind, they became more likely to predict the agent's behavior based on individual mental states instead of category memberships. Thus, as children develop causal understandings of the mechanisms that shape individual behavior, they are more likely to override generic category information to base inferences on the relevant features of specific individuals.},

	Abstract = {Much of our knowledge is acquired not from direct experience but through the speech of others. Speech allows rapid and efficient transfer of information that is otherwise not directly observable. Do infants recognize that speech, even if unfamiliar, can communicate about an important aspect of the world that cannot be directly observed: a person's intentions? Twelve-month-olds saw a person (the Communicator) attempt but fail to achieve a target action (stacking a ring on a funnel). The Communicator subsequently directed either speech or a nonspeech vocalization to another person (the Recipient) who had not observed the attempts. The Recipient either successfully stacked the ring (Intended outcome), attempted but failed to stack the ring (Observable outcome), or performed a different stacking action (Related outcome). Infants recognized that speech could communicate about unobservable intentions, looking longer at Observable and Related outcomes than the Intended outcome when the Communicator used speech. However, when the Communicator used nonspeech, infants looked equally at the three outcomes. Thus, for 12-month-olds, speech can transfer information about unobservable aspects of the world such as internal mental states, which provides preverbal infants with a tool for acquiring information beyond their immediate experience.},

	Abstract = {The ability to sustain attention is a major achievement in human development and is generally believed to be the developmental product of increasing self-regulatory and endogenous (i.e., internal, top-down, voluntary) control over one's attention and cognitive systems [1-5]. Because sustained attention in late infancy is predictive of future development, and because early deficits in sustained attention are markers for later diagnoses of attentional disorders [6], sustained attention is often viewed as a constitutional and individual property of the infant [6-9]. However, humans are social animals; developmental pathways for seemingly non-social competencies evolved within the social group and therefore may be dependent on social experience [10-13]. Here, we show that social context matters for the duration of sustained attention episodes in one-year-old infants during toy play. Using head-mounted eye tracking to record moment-by-moment gaze data from both parents and infants, we found that when the social partner (parent) visually attended to the object to which infant attention was directed, infants, after the parent's look, extended their duration of visual attention to the object. Looks to the same object by two social partners is a well-studied phenomenon known as joint attention, which has been shown to be critical to early learning and to the development of social skills [14, 15]. The present findings implicate joint attention in the development of the child's own sustained attention and thus challenge the current understanding of the origins of individual differences in sustained attention, providing a new and potentially malleable developmental pathway to the self-regulation of attention.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of word orders across languages is highly nonuniform, with subject-verb-object (SVO) and subject-object-verb (SOV) orders being prevalent. Recent work suggests that the SOV order may be the default in human language. Why, then, is SVO order so common? We hypothesize that SOV/SVO variation can be explained by language users' sensitivity to the possibility of noise corrupting the linguistic signal. In particular, the noisy-channel hypothesis predicts a shift from the default SOV order to SVO order for semantically reversible events, for which potential ambiguity arises in SOV order because two plausible agents appear on the same side of the verb. We found support for this prediction in three languages (English, Japanese, and Korean) by using a gesture-production task, which reflects word-order preferences largely independent of native language. Other patterns of crosslinguistic variation (e.g., the prevalence of case marking in SOV languages and its relative absence in SVO languages) also straightforwardly follow from the noisy-channel hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {Overhearing can be seen as an instance of active learning, and overheard speech provides an increasingly viable source of linguistic input across development. However, previous studies of overhearing have often tested learning from simplified, pedagogic, adult-directed speech. This study extends previous results to a more ecologically valid context. Children learn multiple words and facts corresponding to novel toys either through a naturalistic overheard phone call or through direct instruction. Remarkably, 4.5--6-year-olds learned four new words above chance and equally well in both conditions. Their performance on a set of six facts was even better, especially when they were taught them directly. Analysis of the videos revealed that older children with high test accuracy both looked toward the experimenter often, and reliably played with individual objects as she discussed them in her phone call. 3-- 4.5-year-olds, on the other hand, showed a greater difference between overhearing versus direct instruction, with learning from overhearing suffering for both words and facts. While their overheard word-learning was at chance, they were able to learn facts, and succeed at both when taught directly. Together, these results suggest learning from overhearing is driven by attention to the indirect input, and may be a skill that undergoes substantial development during the preschool years.},
	Annote = {This reports a study on pre-schoolers' learning of  facts and words from    overhead speech. It extends initial findings of the efficacy of this type    of learning, is technically sound,  and likely to be of interest to a    broad audience.

Careful    analyses of children's toy manipulation and gaze checking were made to    strengthen conclusions about how word learning was working.

------------------------ Submission 412, Review 
The authors report two experiments examining preschoolers' learning of    novel words and facts from overheard versus direct conversations. The    experiments address an interesting issue and the paper is generally well    written. However, in my opinion the package seems to make a rather small    contribution.    Most of the experimental studies of learning through overhearing have    been conducted with much younger children, so I was looking for a    stronger theoretical rationale for the age group chosen for the current    studies. Also, because it appears that the novel word and facts were    presented together it is not clear that one can conclude that one type of    information is easier to retain or learn than the other.    Other issues:    -    It seems obvious that ``learning from overhearing is driven by    attention to the indirect input'' -- how could it be otherwise?    -    Nothing is made of the fact that children were taught facts about both    novel and familiar objects (Table 1). Why were these not compared in the    analyses?    END OF REVIEW

------------------------ Submission 412, Review 2 This is a very nice paper. Previous work has of course shown that    children can learn words through overhearing, but they have usually    involved unrealistic situations that facilitate learning. This paper    creates more ecologically valid situations of learning and establishes    that children can learn, but makes it clear that their ability to do so    is somewhat fragile even at the age of 3. Its major contribution then is    in taking existing findings and exploring what they actually mean for    real world learning.    A few points:    - The authors use the phrase ``active learning'', which I found    slightly confusing. I am aware of the term as the name of a subfield of    machine learning, and as a term from instructional/pedagogocal theory,    but I assume neither of these are meant here. I think a definition of the    term is required. I also found it confusing when they later use the term    ``self-directed'' learning, with which I am familiar and which I    assumed was basically what they meant by active learning, but seem to    continue to distinguish it from active learning.    - The listening in to a phonecall paradigm was used in Baldwin et al    (1996) in order to explore a similar, albeit differently-framed question.    This should be cited. Also very relevant, and needing discussion here, is    that work of Bannard and Tomasello (2013), where children learned words    through overhearing from a phonecall or in didactic-like situation and    were then found to reveal knowledge in the overhearing case in a    preferential looking test but not in an explicit test, suggesting that    they have implicit but not explicit knowledge of the word, which seems    closely related to the issue of whether learning by overhearing is    ``active'' and what the consequences of being so have for knowledge    retention and use .

Articulation results replicate Bard et al. (2000), depending only on what the speaker has heard. Change between mentions was no greater when it could be inferred that the listener could see the named item (Expt 1), and no less when the listener explicitly denied ability to do so (Expt 2). Word duration fell for speaker- Given listener-New items (Expt 3). Reduction was unaffected by the repeater's ability to see the mentioned landmark (Expt 4). In contrast, referential form was more sensitive to both listener- (Expt 3) and speaker- knowledge (Expt 4). The results conform most closely to a Dual Process model: fast, automatic, processes let the speaker-knowledge prime word articulation, while costly assessments of listener-knowledge influence only referential form.},

	Abstract = {How do comprehenders reason about pragmatically ambiguous scalar terms like some in complex syntactic contexts? In Gricean theories of conversational implicature, local exhaus- tification of such terms (`only some') is predicted to be impossible if it does not strengthen the literal meaning, whereas grammatical accounts of implicature predict such construals to be available. Recent experimental evidence supports the availability of these local enrichments, but the grammatical theories that this evidence supports do not provide viable mechanisms for weighting such construals against others. We propose a probabilistic model that combines previous work on pragmatic inference under `lexical uncertainty' with a more detailed model of compositional semantics. We show that this model makes accurate predictions about new experimental data on embedded implicatures in both non-monotonic and downward-entailing semantic contexts. In addition, the model's predictions can be improved by the incorporation of neo-Gricean hypotheses about lexical alternatives. This work thus contributes to a synthesis of grammatical and probabilistic views on pragmatic inference.},

	Abstract = {Recent research using both naturalistic and experimental methods has found that the vast majority of young children's early language is organized around concrete, item-based linguistic schemas. From this beginning, children then construct more abstract and adult-like linguistic constructions, but only gradually and in piecemeal fashion. These new data present significant problems for nativist accounts of children's language development that use adult-like linguistic categories, structures and formal grammars as analytical tools. Instead, the best account of these data is provided by a usage-based model in which children imitatively learn concrete linguistic expressions from the language they hear around them, and then - using their general cognitive and social-cognitive skills - categorize, schematize and creatively combine these individually learned expressions and structures.

	Abstract = {The form of a determiner is dependent on different contextual factors: in some languages grammatical number and grammatical gender determine the choice of a determiner variant. In other languages, the phonological onset of the element immediately following the determiner affects selection, too. Previous work has shown that the activation of opposing determiner forms by a noun's grammatical properties leads to slower naming latencies in a picture naming task, as does the activation of opposing forms by the interaction between a noun's gender and the phonological context. The present paper addresses the question of whether phonological context alone is sufficient to evoke competition between determiner forms. Participants produced English phrases in which a noun phrase's phonology required a determiner that was the same as or differed from the determiner required by the noun itself (e.g., a purple giraffe; an orange giraffe). Naming latencies were slower when the phrase-initial determiner differed from the determiner required by the noun in isolation than when the phrase-initial determiner matched the isolated-noun determiner. This was true both for definite and indefinite determiners. The data show that during the production of a determiner-noun phrase, nouns automatically activate the phonological forms of their determiners, which can compete with the phonological forms that are generated by an assimilation rule. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Search was especially efficient in a task environment that was representative of real-world experiences. This suggests that children may use their knowledge of real-world environmental statistics to guide their search behavior. We also compared different related search tasks.

Here, we explore how young children and infants learn about the rational deployment of effort through observing adults' persistent behavior. Results from Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that preschoolers persist more after watching an adult persist, but only if the adult is successful at reaching their goal. Experiment 3 extends these findings, showing that even infants use adult models to modulate their persistence, and can generalize this inference to novel situations. Thus, both preschoolers and infants are sensitive to adult persistence and use it to calibrate their own tenacity.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies have documented that children are slow to acquire adjectives into their productive vocabulary. Yet in laboratory studies, even very young children can extend novel adjectives to new instances. Two studies examined the relation between children's acquisition of adjectives and children's emerging knowledge about nouns. In Study 1, the input parents provide to children when talking about properties was examined. The results indicate that the type of input provided in laboratory experiments is infrequent in parent speech to children, and that parents often talk about adjectives using syntax that is ambiguous as to the adjectival status of the words and confusable with nouns. In Study 2 children participated in a training study designed to teach children color words without strong syntactic cues. In Study 3 children participated in a training study designed to teach children color words with syntactic cues that strongly indicated the adjectival status of the word. The results show that younger children who had fewer nouns in their productive vocabulary learned more without strong syntactic cues whereas the older children who had more nouns in their productive vocabulary were more likely to benefit from hearing strong syntactic cues.

	Abstract = {Past research has shown that young monolingual children exhibit language-based social biases: they prefer native language to foreign language speakers. The current research investigated how children's language preferences are influenced by their own bilingualism and by a speaker's bilingualism. Monolingual and bilingual 4- to 6-year-olds heard pairs of adults (a monolingual and a bilingual, or two monolinguals) and chose the person with whom they wanted to be friends. Whether they were from a largely monolingual or a largely bilingual community, monolingual children preferred monolingual to bilingual speakers, and native language to foreign language speakers. In contrast, bilingual children showed similar affiliation with monolingual and bilingual speakers, as well as for monolingual speakers using their dominant versus non-dominant language. Exploratory analyses showed that individual bilinguals displayed idiosyncratic patterns of preference. These results reveal that language-based preferences emerge from a complex interaction of factors, including preference for in-group members, avoidance of out-group members, and characteristics of the child as they relate to the status of the languages within the community. Moreover, these results have implications for bilingual children's social acceptance by their peers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

@article{Song2015,
	Abstract = {Extensive studies have demonstrated that face recognition performance does not reach adult levels until adolescence. However, there is no consensus on whether such prolonged improvement stems from development of general cognitive factors or face-specific mechanisms. Here, we used behavioral experiments and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate these two hypotheses. With a large cohort of children (n = 379), we found that the ability of face-specific recognition in humans increased with age throughout childhood and into late adolescence in both face memory and face perception. Neurally, to circumvent the potential problem of age differences in task performance, attention, or cognitive strategies in task-state fMRI studies, we measured the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA) in human brain and found that the OFA-FFA RSFC increased until 11-13 years of age. Moreover, the OFA-FFA RSFC was selectively impaired in adults with developmental prosopagnosia (DP). In contrast, no age-related changes or differences between DP and normal adults were observed for RSFCs in the object system. Finally, the OFA-FFA RSFC matured earlier than face selectivity in either the OFA or FFA. These results suggest the critical role of the OFA-FFA RSFC in the development of face recognition. Together, our findings support the hypothesis that prolonged development of face recognition is face specific, not domain general. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: There is long-standing debate on whether the prolonged age-related improvement in face recognition performance stems from development of general cognitive factors or face-specific mechanisms. Here, we provide novel evidence for protracted development of face-specific mechanisms. Specifically, the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the fusiform face area and occipital face area, two core brain areas in the face network, increased until 11-13 years of age and was selectively impaired in adults with developmental prosopagnosia. These results suggested the importance of the face network RSFC in the development of face recognition. Our study invites a broader investigation of whether the development of other cognitive abilities is similarly guided by the development of connectivity within the corresponding neural networks},

	Abstract = {Although previous research has shown that listeners can use prosody to resolve syntactic ambiguities in spoken sentences, it is not clear whether naive, untrained speakers in experimental situations ordinarily produce the prosodic cues necessary for disambiguating such sentences. In a series of experiments, the authors found that neither professional nor untrained speakers consistently produced such prosodic cues when simply reading ambiguous sentences in a disambiguating discourse context. Speakers who were aware of the ambiguities and were told to intentionally pronounce the sentences with one meaning or the other, however, did produce sufficient prosodic cues for listeners to identify the intended meanings.},

	Abstract = {Previous work suggests that preschoolers understand that members of some social groups (e.g., based on occupation or gender) speak in distinct ways, but do not understand that members of other social groups (e.g., based on race, culture, or nationality) speak different languages. In these four studies we explored preschool children's inferences about language and social group membership. In Study 1 we found that preschoolers believed that minority race individuals, people wearing unf{\~{}}ili{\~{}} clothing, or people living in unfamiliar dwellings were more likely to speak an unfamiliar foreign language than to speak English. Studies 2A and 2B showed that children do not map social group differences to language for all social categories. Specifically, children were more likely to attribute language differences to racial rather than age differences and were more likely to map differences in music preference onto age than racial differences. Results of Study 3 showed children's inferences about language and social group differences were not derived from differences in intelligibility. Study 4 provides insight into why children readily make these language to social kind mappings by identifying a common property that both broad social kinds and distinct languages are thought to share. Together these studies provide evidence that even preschoolers may for help with the experiments. We would also like to thankTessa Hirschfeld-Staler, for providing speech samples, and Bruce Harold for help in preparing the speech stimuli.

The relationships among early phonological skills, letter knowledge, grammatical skills, and vocabulary knowledge were investigated as predictors of word recognition and reading comprehension. Word recognition skills were consistently predicted by earlier measures of letter knowledge and phoneme sensitivity (but not by vocabulary knowledge, rhyme skills, or grammatical skills). In contrast, reading comprehension was predicted by prior word recognition skills, vocabulary knowledge, and grammatical skills. The results are related to current theories about the role of phonological, grammatical, and vocabulary skills in the development of early reading skills.},

In the both condition, classes received the interactive lecture and also designed and ran experiments. We assessed students' understanding using a written test of their ability to distinguish valid from invalid experimental comparisons. Performance on this test improved from the pretest to the immediate posttest in all conditions, and gains were maintained at a 5-month delay. For students from both higher and lower achieving schools, gains ordered as follows: both {\textgreater} instruct {\textgreater} manipulate. However, students from higher achieving schools showed greater gains in all conditions. Item analyses showed that the interactive lecture improved students' understanding of the need to control irrelevant variables, and experimentation improved students' understanding of the need to vary the focal variable.},

Previous work has shown that imitation is strongly moderated by social preference in adults, and that social preference affects children's speech acquisition within peer groups. Such findings have led to the suggestion that phonetic imitation is related to larger processes of sound change in a change-by-accommodation model. This study examines how preferential processing of particular voice types affects spontaneous phonetic accommodation, interpreting the results in the context of how sound change can be propagated through a speech community. To explore this question eight model talkers previously rated as attractive, unattractive, typical, and atypical for each gender were used in an auditory naming paradigm. Twenty participants completed the task, and an AXB measure was used to quantify imitation. Female participants imitated more than male participants, but this varied across model voices. Females were found to rely more on social preference than men, while both groups imitated the atypical voices. The results suggest that females adapt their speech to auditory input more readily, but the nature of the accommodation does not qualify as direct evidence for a change-by-accommodation model given the constrained context of the task.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Measures of attention have been found to correlate with specific auditory processing tests in samples of children suspected of Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), but these relationships have not been adequately investigated. Despite evidence linking auditory attention and deficits/symptoms of APD, measures of attention are not routinely used in APD diagnostic protocols. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between auditory and visual attention tests and auditory processing tests in children with APD and to assess whether a proposed diagnostic protocol for APD, including measures of attention, could provide useful information for APD management. A pilot study including 27 children, aged 7-11 years, referred for APD assessment was conducted. The validated test of everyday attention for children, with visual and auditory attention tasks, the listening in spatialized noise sentences test, the children's communication checklist questionnaire and tests from a standard APD diagnostic test battery were administered. Pearson's partial correlation analysis examining the relationship between these tests and Cochrane's Q test analysis comparing proportions of diagnosis under each proposed battery were conducted. Divided auditory and divided auditory-visual attention strongly correlated with the dichotic digits test, r = 0.68, p {\textless} 0.05, and r = 0.76, p = 0.01, respectively, in a sample of 20 children with APD diagnosis. The standard APD battery identified a larger proportion of participants as having APD, than an attention battery identified as having Attention Deficits (ADs). The proposed APD battery excluding AD cases did not have a significantly different diagnosis proportion than the standard APD battery. Finally, the newly proposed diagnostic battery, identifying an inattentive subtype of APD, identified five children who would have otherwise been considered not having ADs. The findings show that a subgroup of children with APD demonstrates underlying sustained and divided attention deficits. Attention deficits in children with APD appear to Stavrinos et al. Auditory Processing Disorder and Attention be centred around the auditory modality but further examination of types of attention in both modalities is required. Revising diagnostic criteria to incorporate attention tests and the inattentive type of APD in the test battery, provides additional useful data to clinicians to ensure careful interpretation of APD assessments.},

It is delightful indeed to see that he has considered that there may be implications for research in language acquisition and development, and how differences in the semantic representation might facilitate learners encoding a distinction among linguistic constructions (pp. 33-34).

	Abstract = {Common stereotypes associate high-level intellectual ability (brilliance, genius, etc.) with men more than women. These stereotypes discourage women's pursuit of many prestigious careers; that is, women are underrepresented in fields whose members cherish brilliance (such as physics and philosophy). Here we show that these stereotypes are endorsed by, and influence the interests of, children as young as 6. Specifically, 6-year-old girls are less likely than boys to believe that members of their gender are ``really, really smart.'' Also at age 6, girls begin to avoid activities said to be for children who are ``really, really smart.'' These findings suggest that gendered notions of brilliance are acquired early and have an immediate effect on children's interests.},

	Abstract = {Recent research has produced new insights into the early development of social cognition and social learning. Even very young children learn and understand social activities as governed by conventional norms that (a) are arbitrary and shared by the community, (b) have normative force and apply to all participants, and (c) are valid in context-relative ways. Importantly, such understanding is revealed both in the fact that children themselves follow the norms, and in the fact that they actively enforce them toward third parties. Human social cognition thus has a fundamental normative dimension that begins early. This norm psychology plausibly evolved due to its role in stabilizing group coordination and cooperation, and is one of the foundations of what is uniquely human social learning and culture.},

	Abstract = {Despite the fact that midday naps are characteristic of early childhood, very little is understood about the structure and function of these sleep bouts. Given that sleep benefits memory in young adults, it is possible that naps serve a similar function for young children. However, children transition from biphasic to monophasic sleep patterns in early childhood, eliminating the nap from their daily sleep schedule. As such, naps may contain mostly light sleep stages and serve little function for learning and memory during this transitional age. Lacking scientific understanding of the function of naps in early childhood, policy makers may eliminate preschool classroom nap opportunities due to increasing curriculum demands. Here we show evidence that classroom naps support learning in preschool children by enhancing memories acquired earlier in the day compared with equivalent intervals spent awake. This nap benefit is greatest for children who nap habitually, regardless of age. Performance losses when nap-deprived are not recovered during subsequent overnight sleep. Physiological recordings of naps support a role of sleep spindles in memory performance. These results suggest that distributed sleep is critical in early learning; when short-term memory stores are limited, memory consolidation must take place frequently.},

	Abstract = {How do children's representations of object categories change as they grow older? As they learn about the world around them, they also express what they know in the drawings they make. Here, we examine drawings as a window into how children represent familiar object categories, and how this changes across childhood. We asked children (age 3-10 years) to draw familiar object categories on an iPad. First, we analyzed their semantic content, finding large and consistent gains in how well children could produce drawings that are recognizable to adults. Second, we quantified their perceptual similarity to adult drawings using a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, allowing us to visualize the representational layout of object categories across age groups using a common feature basis. We found that the organization of object categories in older children's drawings were more similar to that of adults than younger children's drawings. This correspondence was strong in the final layers of the neural network, showing that older children's drawings tend to capture the perceptual features critical for adult recognition. We hypothesize that this improvement reflects increasing convergence between chil-dren's representations of object categories and that of adults; future work will examine how these age-related changes relate to children's developing perceptual and motor capacities. Broadly, these findings point to drawing as a rich source of insight into how children represent object concepts.},

@article{Reali2009,
	Abstract = {The regularization of linguistic structures by learners has played a key role in arguments for strong innate constraints on language acquisition, and has important implications for language evolution. However, relating the inductive biases of learners to regularization behavior in laboratory tasks can be challenging without a formal model. In this paper we explore how regular linguistic structures can emerge from language evolution by iterated learning, in which one person's linguistic output is used to generate the linguistic input provided to the next person. We use a model of iterated learning with Bayesian agents to show that this process can result in regularization when learners have the appropriate inductive biases. We then present three experiments demonstrating that simulating the process of language evolution in the laboratory can reveal biases towards regularization that might not otherwise be obvious, allowing weak biases to have strong effects. The results of these experiments suggest that people tend to regularize inconsistent word-meaning mappings, and that even a weak bias towards regularization can allow regular languages to be produced via language evolution by iterated learning. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {In our L1 acquisition experiment, we tested between the Language-based and Rationality-based accounts of how Relevance implicatures are computed, and found support for the Language-based account but not the Rationality-based account. While on the Language-based account (e.g., Horn, 1984; Levinson, 2000), Relevance implicatures are situated within the language module, on the Rationality-based account (Kasher, 1991), they are not situated within the language module, and are interpreted as being derived by Rationality-based reasoning, which is also instrumental in deriving non-linguistic inferences. We tested children aged 5;1-8;1 on computing Relevance implicatures and non-linguistic inferences that were parallel in nature. On the Language-based account, children were predicted to perform better on computing non-linguistic inferences than Relevance implicatures that are parallel in nature because in order to compute Relevance implicatures children need to master additional linguistic prerequisites. On the Rationality-based account, children were not predicted to perform better on computing non-linguistic inferences than Relevance implicatures. We found that children performed significantly better on computing non-linguistic inferences than Relevance implicatures, which provided evidence for the Language-based account. We argue that reasoning about language, and specifically, about the role of seemingly irrelevant utterances in discourse, constitutes the main acquisition challenge with respect to Relevance implicatures. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Taylor  {\&}  Francis. Inspired by Syrett (2013), three experiments explored children's ability to distinguish attributives (e.g., ``three-pound strawberries,'' where MPs as adjectives signal reference to attributes) versus pseudopartitives (e.g., ``three pounds of strawberries,'' where MPs combine with of to signal part-whole relations). Given the systematic nature of the syntax-semantics mapping, we asked whether children are able to use syntax to interpret how entities are quantified. In Experiment 1, four- and five-year-olds were asked to choose between two characters for the one who was selling appropriate items matching an attributive or pseudopartitive expression. In Experiment 2, children of the same age heard items described with a phrase using either an attributive, a pseudopartitive, ``each'' (``each weighs three pounds''), or ``all together'' (``all together they weigh three pounds''). At test, with some items removed, children were asked whether the same phrase applied to the remaining items (e.g., ``Does Dora still have three-pound strawberries?''). Children did not distinguish between attributives and pseudopartitives but did so for ``each'' and ``all together.'' Experiment 3 extends the age range with a third experimental design. Children heard ``each'' or ``all together'' descriptions (e.g., ``each strawberry weighs three pounds'') and judged, at test, which of two characters ``said it better'' (i.e., ``Mickey says `these are two pounds of strawberries,' but Donald says `these are two-pound strawberries.'''). Children under 6 were at chance. Together, the three experiments suggest that despite its systematicity, children do not automatically appreciate the mapping between syntax and semantics.},

	Abstract = {Most theorists agree that people's categorization of artifacts is influenced by two factors: (a) in what respect objects are similar, and (b) to what degree objects are similar. Research with children has identified two respects - physical appearance and function - which are important for the categorization of artifacts. Previous work, however, has not mapped decisively the relative contribution of each of these respects to children's categorization decisions. In the present study, children and adults were shown a novel standard object and were asked to categorize 10 test objects of varying degrees of physical and functional similarity to the standard. We found that while adults included as category members objects of high functional similarity even if of low physical similarity, children accepted as members only objects that were highly similar to the standard both functionally and physically. In other words, children and adults weighted functional similarity comparably, but children gave more weight than adults to physical similarity. These results may help illuminate the conflicting findings and theories on the development of artifact categories. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kuhl2005,
	Abstract = {In this article, we present a summary of recent research linking speech perception in infancy to later language development, as well as a new empirical study examin- ing that linkage. Infant phonetic discrimination is initially language universal, but a decline in phonetic discrimination occurs for nonnative phonemes by the end of the 1st year. Exploiting this transition in phonetic perception between 6 and 12 months of age, we tested the hypothesis that the decline in nonnative phonetic dis- crimination is associated with native-language phonetic learning. Using a standard behavioral measure of speech discrimination in infants at 7 months and measures of their language abilities at 14, 18, 24, and 30 months, we show (a) a negative cor- relation between infants' early native and nonnative phonetic discrimination skills and (b) that native- and nonnative-phonetic discrimination skills at 7 months differ- entially predict future language ability. Better native-language discrimination at 7 months predicts accelerated later language abilities, whereas better nonnative-lan- guage discrimination at 7 months predicts reduced later language abilities. The dis- cussion focuses on (a) the theoretical connection between speech perception and language development and (b) the implications of these findings for the putative ``critical period'' for phonetic learning.

@article{Bergelson2012,
	Abstract = {It is widely accepted that infants begin learning their native language not by learning words, but by discovering features of the speech signal: consonants, vowels, and combinations of these sounds. Learning to understand words, as opposed to just perceiving their sounds, is said to come later, between 9 and 15 mo of age, when infants develop a capacity for interpreting others' goals and intentions. Here, we demonstrate that this consensus about the developmental sequence of human language learning is flawed: in fact, infants already know the meanings of several common words from the age of 6 mo onward. We presented 6- to 9-mo-old infants with sets of pictures to view while their parent named a picture in each set. Over this entire age range, infants directed their gaze to the named pictures, indicating their understanding of spoken words. Because the words were not trained in the laboratory, the results show that even young infants learn ordinary words through daily experience with language. This surprising accomplishment indicates that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, either infants can already grasp the referential intentions of adults at 6 mo or infants can learn words before this ability emerges. The precocious discovery of word meanings suggests a perspective in which learning vocabulary and learning the sound structure of spoken language go hand in hand as language acquisition begins.},

@article{Brown2018,
	Abstract = {In consumer goods markets, theory shows that it is generally profitable for sellers to use search-deterrence strategies to alter buyer search. These results rely on agents' reacting solely to the economic content of these pressure tactics, ignoring any behaviorally based responses search deterrence may evoke. To test the validity of this assumption, this paper examines an experimental market where profit-maximizing strategy dictates that sellers should exercise one form of search deterrence, exploding offers. Sellers demonstrate a reluctance to use such offers against human buyers, but they are less reluctant to use them against computerized buyers. Human buyers are three times more likely to deviate from optimal strategy by rejecting rather than accepting these offers. Survey responses are consistent with other-regarding-preference-based reasons for sellers' actions but not buyers'. Taken together, these results suggest the benefits of tactics that rely on pressuring decision-makers may be more nebulous than previously thought.},

	Abstract = {Over the first year of life, infant perception changes radically as the child learns the phonology of the ambient language from the speech she is exposed to. Since infant-directed speech attracts the child's attention more than other registers, it is necessary to describe that input in order to under- stand language development, and to address questions of learnability. In this review, evidence from corpora analyses, experimental studies, and observational paradigms is brought together to outline the first comprehensive empirical picture of infant-directed speech and its effects on language acquisition. The ensuing landscape suggests that infant-directed speech provides an emotionally and linguistically rich input to language acquisition.},

	Abstract = {The respective literature on science and math learning provide many detailed analyses of the alternative conceptual frameworks that students bring to the classroom and of the conceptual changes necessary for students to learn the concepts that are the targets of instruction. Examples range from young students' understanding of number, astronomy, biology, and matter to the high school and college students' understanding of mechanics, chemistry, thermal phenomena, or evolution. This paper shows that, for the average student, the conceptual changes sketched here are not completed until well into the second decade of life.},
	Annote = {one of my favorite articles ever

I really enjoyed the Carey article, in part because the philosophy of science knowledge she discussed as a critical component of early science education is pretty close to the understanding that I think many undergraduates don't have, and makes teaching critical thinking about any scientific product really difficult. I have never seen any efforts to teach something like the difference between data and evidence, or the necessity of interpretative frameworks, to young people, but think it *should* be a part of science education, and start getting introduced as young as the Keleman study, and with the same motivation to preempt competing commonsense interpretations. The instruction of the Scientific Method in middle school is an example of a theme that came up in all the readings, of early piecemeal, superficial, or simplistic instruction posing an obstacle to students' deeper, mechanistic understanding in later instruction.},

	Abstract = {Explaining the variation between human languages and the constraints on that variation is a core goal of linguistics. In the last 20 y, it has been claimed that many striking universals of cross-linguistic variation follow from a hypothetical principle that dependency length-the distance between syntactically related words in a sentence-is minimized. Various models of human sentence production and comprehension predict that long dependencies are difficult or inefficient to process; minimizing dependency length thus enables effective communication without incurring processing difficulty. However, despite widespread application of this idea in theoretical, empirical, and practical work, there is not yet large-scale evidence that dependency length is actually minimized in real utterances across many languages; previous work has focused either on a small number of languages or on limited kinds of data about each language. Here, using parsed corpora of 37 diverse languages, we show that overall dependency lengths for all languages are shorter than conservative random baselines. The results strongly suggest that dependency length minimization is a universal quantitative property of human languages and support explanations of linguistic variation in terms of general properties of human information processing.},
	Annote = {language universals are grounded in the known properties of human information processing
grammars of langs have evolved so that users can communicate using sentences relatively easy to both produce and comprehend
short dependencies are easier or more efficient to produce and comprehend than long ones

Dependency Length Minimization Hypothesis
1) when L provides multiple ways to express idea, users will prefer expression with shortest dependency length
2) grammars should not enforce word orders with long dependencies

Studies have typically looked at categorical descriptions of langs or small numbers of them

Is dependency length actually minimized overall in real utterances, considering the full range of possible constructions and word orders as they are used?
want to test if dependency lengths shorter than would be expected by chance

dependency-parsed corpora of 37 langs from 10 lang families: written prose (newspapers, novels, blogs), aslo Latin {\&} Ancient Greek (lots of poetry), Japanese (spoken dialogue)

compare to counterfactual baseline orders repping L users who who choose utterances without regard for dependency length (speaking languages unnaffected by DLM)

also present optimal baseline for minimum possible dependency length

Free Word Order Baseline
fully random projective linearization of dep trees: starting at root, collect head and dependents, randomly order, repeat process for each dependent - 100 times for each sentence to use as comparison for real dependency lengths of that sentence
--{\textgreater} comparisons resemble free word order L

all langs have avg dep lengths shorter than random baseline, esp. for longer sentences

regression models predicting dep length as function of sentence length

dependency length of *real* sentences grows more slowly than dep length of baseline sentences

length 12 shorted sentence length to show sig effect in all langs

Fixed Word Order Baseline
linearize sentence according to fixed relative ordering of dependency types (subject, object, prepositional object, etc.)

more conservative: avg dep lengths of fixed word order baseline shorter than free word order ones

large-scale crosslinguistic support 
shorter than random baselines, but longer than minimal baselines

other pressures: dependency structure needs to be able to be recovered incrementally: linearizations should allow comprehender to quickly identify syntactic and semantic props of each word

Variance in effect size of DLM across langs
head-final langs (e.g., Japanese, Korean, Turkish) show much less minimization than head-final langs (Italian, Indonesian, Irish)

head-final langs often have highly informative morph that might give more freedom re dep length, because deps easier to id (long dependencies in German, which has case marking, cause less processing difficulty than long ones in English)

	Abstract = {If speakers articulate clearly enough to meet the perceptual needs of their listeners, clarity should depend on what listeners know about (listener-Given) rather than on what speakers know about (speaker-Given). For words excerpted from spontaneous speech, however, intelligibility to naive adult listeners showed only effects of the speaker's knowledge. Words introducing labeled map landmarks to two successive listeners were less clear on repetition even though the second listener had not heard the original mention (Experiment 1). Repeated mentions became less clear even after the listener reported inability to see the landmark (Experiment 2). Speakers were affected by what they had heard listeners mention: Intelligibility fell equally in coreferential repetitions across and within speakers (Experiment 3), whether or not the repeater could see the referent (Experiment 4). The results are explained via fast priming processes dependent on the speaker's knowledge and slow, optional processes drawing inferences about the listener's. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press},

Cross-cultural studies typically focus on group differences in age-related stages relative to Western norms. We adopted a less traditional approach: We observed 5-month-olds and their mothers from six cultural groups around the world during 1 hr at home while they engaged in natural daily activities. We examined group differences in infants' sitting proficiency, everyday opportunities to practice sitting, the surfaces on which sitting took place, and mothers' proximity to sitting infants. Infants had opportunities to practice sitting in varied contexts--including ground, infant chairs, and raised surfaces. Proficiency varied considerably within and between cultural groups: 64{\%} of the sample sat only with support from mother or furniture and 36{\%} sat independently. Some infants sat unsupported for 20+ min, in some cases so securely that mothers moved beyond arms' reach of their infants even while infants sat on raised surfaces. Our observations of infant sitting across cultures provide new insights into the striking range of ability, varied opportunities for practice, and contextual factors that influence the proficiency of infant motor skills.},

In this study, we explored how the amount of speech directed to infants in Spanish-speaking families low in socioeconomic status influenced the development of children's skill in real-time language processing and vocabulary learning. All-day recordings of parent-infant interactions at home revealed striking variability among families in how much speech caregivers addressed to their child. Infants who experienced more child-directed speech became more efficient in processing familiar words in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24 months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to vocabulary outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that the effect of child-directed speech on expressive vocabulary was explained by infants' language-processing efficiency, which suggests that richer language experience strengthens processing skills that facilitate language growth.},

	Abstract = {Humans' preference for others who share our group membership is well documented, and this heightened valuation of in-group members seems to be rooted in early development. Before 12 mo of age, infants already showbehavioral preferences for others who evidence cues to same-group membership such as race or native language, yet the function of this selectivity remains unclear. We examine one of these social biases, the preference for native speak- ers, and propose that this preference may result from infants' mo- tivation to obtain information and the expectation that interactions with native speakers will provide better opportunities for learning. To investigate this hypothesis, we measured EEG theta activity, a neural rhythm shown to index active and selective preparation for encoding information in adults. In study 1,weestablished that 11-mo- old infants exhibit an increase in theta activation in situations when they can expect to receive information. We then used this neural measure of anticipatory theta activity to explore the expectations of 11-mo-olds when facing social partners who either speak the infants' native language or a foreign tongue (study 2). A larger in- crease in theta oscillationswas observedwhen infants could expect to receive information from the native speaker, indicating that in- fants were preparing to learn information from the native speaker to a greater extent than from the foreign speaker. While previous research has demonstrated that infants prefer to interact with knowledgeable others, the current experiments provide evidence that such an information-seeking motive may also underpin infants' demonstrated preference for native speakers. social},

	Abstract = {Birdsong is considered a model of human speech development at behavioral and neural levels. Few direct tests of the proposed analogs exist, however. Here we test a mechanism of phonological development in human infants that is based on social shaping, a selective learning process first documented in songbirds. By manipulating mothers' reactions to their 8-month-old infants' vocalizations, we demonstrate that phonological features of babbling are sensitive to nonimitative social stimulation. Contingent, but not noncontingent, maternal behavior facilitates more complex and mature vocal behavior. Changes in vocalizations persist after the manipulation. The data show that human infants use social feedback, facilitating immediate transitions in vocal behavior. Social interaction creates rapid shifts to developmentally more advanced sounds. These transitions mirror the normal development of speech, supporting the predictions of the avian social shaping model. These data provide strong support for a parallel in function between vocal precursors of songbirds and infants. Because imitation is usually considered the mechanism for vocal learning in both taxa, the findings introduce social shaping as a general process underlying the development of speech and song.},

	Abstract = {The current study investigates the influence of lexical factors on phonetic convergence and explores the relationship between acoustic and perceptual measures of convergence. A set of talkers produced baseline and shadowed tokens of target words that varied in frequency and phonological neighbor density independently. Experiment 1 demonstrated the impact of lexical factors on vowel dispersion in speech production. In Experiment 2, separate listeners judged the relative similarity of shadowed to model tokens in an AXB perceptual test of phonetic convergence. Acoustic measures of inter-talker distances in duration, fundamental frequency, and vowel formants for baseline and shadowed speech were compared to the perceptual measures. A mixed-effects regression model using a combination of acoustic convergence measures predicted perceived phonetic convergence better than lexical factors or individual acoustic attributes alone. These findings have important methodological and theoretical implications for understanding the complexities of phonetic convergence. Studies of convergence should consider examining acoustic and perceptual measures in tandem. Lexical factors impact speech production and perception, but their effects appear to be independent of those that evoke phonetic convergence. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

These objects are causally different than standard artifacts (e.g. hammers, chairs, and cars), sharing more commonality with other social roles. Thus, they inform psychological theories of human-made objects as well as children's emerging understanding of social reality. We examined whether children (N = 180, ages 4--9) differentiate institutional objects from standard artifacts. Specifically, we examine whether children understand that mutual intentions (i.e., the intentions of a social collective) underlie the functional affordances of institutional objects in ways that they do not for standard artifacts. We find that young children assimilate institutional objects into their intuitive theories of standard artifacts; children begin to differentiate between the domains in the elementary school years.},

Each child's ability to speak and understand is a moving target, changing yearly, weekly, even daily. How could adults adapt to these changes? Evidence shows that in conversation both adults and children try to establish, as they go along, the mutual belief that they have understood each other well enough for current purposes. It is this process, called grounding, that allows adults to infer the child's current abilities and to adapt their speech to that child. Adults, then, learn how to talk with children in the very act of talking with them.},

	Abstract = {Curiosity is a basic element of our cognition, but its biological function, mechanisms, and neural underpinning remain poorly understood. It is nonetheless a motivator for learning, influential in decision-making, and crucial for healthy development. One factor limiting our understanding of it is the lack of a widely agreed upon delineation of what is and is not curiosity. Another factor is the dearth of standardized laboratory tasks that manipulate curiosity in the lab. Despite these barriers, recent years have seen a major growth of interest in both the neuroscience and psychology of curiosity. In this Perspective, we advocate for the importance of the field, provide a selective overview of its current state, and describe tasks that are used to study curiosity and information-seeking. We propose that, rather than worry about defining curiosity, it is more helpful to consider the motivations for information-seeking behavior and to study it in its ethological context.},

	Abstract = {I propose that research on the role of common ground in language use is often insensi- tive to considerations of parsimony. By ignoring parsimony, our experiments might fall short of addressing common ground and instead the resulting data support a sim- pler theory which is subsumed within the theory of common ground. In order to address this inherent conceptual confound, this paper proposes the subsuming theory criterion for experiments on common ground and mutual knowledge. In practical terms, to demonstrate an effect of common ground the design must keep common information constant and only vary whether or not it is common. The paper demon- strates how consistent use of this necessary criterion will allow us to make stronger claims about when common ground plays a role and when it does not To illustrate how experiments can be designed to satisfy the criterion, the paper evaluates some ear- lier studies which do and don't satisfy i t In general, the study of language use could benefit from tightening the rules of evidence, allowing us to draw stronger conclusions about central concepts such as common ground.},

	Abstract = {Children learn causal relationships quickly and make far-reaching causal inferences from what they observe. Acquiring abstract causal principles that allow generalization across different causal relationships could support these abilities. We examine children's ability to acquire abstract knowledge about the forms of causal relationships and show that in some cases they learn better than adults. Adults and 4- and 5-year-old children saw events suggesting that a causal relationship took one of two different forms, and their generalization to a new set of objects was then tested. One form was a more typical disjunctive relationship; the other was a more unusual conjunctive relationship. Participants were asked to both judge the causal efficacy of the objects and to design actions to generate or prevent an effect. Our results show that children can learn the abstract properties of causal relationships using only a handful of events. Moreover, children were more likely than adults to generalize the unusual conjunctive relationship, suggesting that they are less biased by prior assumptions and pay more attention to current evidence. These results are consistent with the predictions of a hierarchical Bayesian model. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

	Abstract = {Children as young as two years of age are able to learn novel object labels through overhearing, even when distracted by an attractive toy (Akhtar, 2005). The present studies varied the information provided about novel objects and examined which elements (i.e. novel versus neutral information and labels versus facts) toddlers chose to monitor, and what type of information they were more likely to learn. In Study 1, participants learned only the novel label and the novel fact containing a novel label. In Study 2, only girls learned the novel label. Neither girls nor boys learned the novel fact. In both studies, analyses of children's gaze patterns suggest that children who learned the new information strategically oriented to the third-party conversation.},

The experiments use the unique acquisition situations of childhood deafness and sign language. The key factors controlled across the studies are age of L1 acquisition, the sensory--motor modality of the language, and level of linguistic structure. Findings consistent across the studies show age of L1 acquisition to be a determining factor in the success of both L1 and L2 acquisition. Sensory--motor modality shows no general or specific effects. It is of importance that the effects of age of L1 acquisition on both L1 and L2 outcome are apparent across levels of linguistic structure, namely, syntax, phonology, and the lexicon. The results demonstrate that L1 acquisition bestows not only facility with the linguistic structure of the L1, but also the ability to learn linguistic structure in the L2.},

Participants were randomly assigned to try to live this month (LTM) like it was their last in their current city (time scarcity intervention; n = 69) or to keep track of their daily activities (neutral control; n = 70). Each group reported their activities and their psychological need satisfaction (connectedness, competence, and autonomy) weekly for 4 weeks. At baseline, post-intervention, and 2-week follow-up, participants reported their well-being--a composite of life satisfaction, positive emotions, and negative emotions. Participants in the LTM condition increased in well-being over time compared to the control group. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that these differences in well-being were explained by greater connectedness, competence, and autonomy. Thus, imagining time as scarce prompted people to seize the moment and extract greater well-being from their lives.},

In Expt 1, 4- and 5-year-olds accurately attributed false beliefs based on direct perception, but did not attribute false beliefs based on inferential or interpretive processes. Experiment 2 compared children's ability to predict another person's interpretation with children's ability to explain another person's interpretation after the fact. Although 4-year-olds often provided valid explanations, 7-year-olds were more likely than 4-year-olds to refer to another person's previous experiences to explain the person's interpretation References to previous experiences were positively correlated with the ability to predict another person's interpretation These results support the view that understanding false belief and understanding interpretive activity are distinct conceptual acquisitions.},

	Abstract = {Recent research indicates that infants can learn novel words equally well through addressed speech as through overhearing two adult experimenters. The current study examined to which extent six-year-old children learn from overhearing opportunities in regular kindergarten classroom practices. Fifty-three children (M age = 5;6) were exposed to a story with twelve novel words in three different conditions. In the Addressed condition, children were directly addressed to listen to the story. In the Overhearing Classroom, the children were assigned to a task within earshot of the children of the Addressed condition. In the Overhearing Two Adults condition, the experimenter told the story to another adult. The results showed that the Addressees learned equally well as the Overhearers of Two Adults. However, in the Overhearing Classroom condition children learned significantly fewer words compared to the two other conditions. Different hypotheses are offered to explain the relative success of overhearing two adults compared to overhearing classroom interactions.

	Abstract = {Math anxiety is a negative affective reaction to situations involving math. Previous work demonstrates that math anxiety can negatively impact math problem solving by creating performance-related worries that disrupt the working memory needed for the task at hand. By leveraging knowledge about the mechanism underlying the math anxiety-performance relationship, we tested the effectiveness of a short expressive writing intervention that has been shown to reduce intrusive thoughts and improve working memory availability. Students (N = 80) varying in math anxiety were asked to sit quietly (control group) prior to completing difficulty-matched math and word problems or to write about their thoughts and feelings regarding the exam they were about to take (expressive writing group). For the control group, high math-anxious individuals (HMAs) performed significantly worse on the math problems than low math-anxious students (LMAs). In the expressive writing group, however, this difference in math performance across HMAs and LMAs was significantly reduced. Among HMAs, the use of words related to anxiety, cause, and insight in their writing was positively related to math performance. Expressive writing boosts the performance of anxious students in math-testing situations.},

Instead of teaching simple facts, we provided a rich conceptual framework that helped children understand the need to eat a variety of healthy foods. Using the insight that children's knowledge can be organized into coherent belief systems, or intuitive theories, we (a) analyzed the incipient knowledge that guides young children's reasoning about the food-body relationship, (b) identified the prerequisites that children need to conceptualize food as a source of nutrition, and (c) devised a strategy for teaching young children a coherent theory of food as a source of diverse nutrients. In these two experiments, we showed that children can learn and generalize this conceptual framework. Moreover, this learning led children to eat more vegetables at snack time. Our findings demonstrate that young children can benefit from an intervention that capitalizes on their developing intuitive theories about nutrition.},

	Abstract = {Executive functions (EFs; e.g., reasoning, working memory, and self-control) can be improved. Good news indeed, since EFs are critical for school and job success and for mental and physical health. Various activities appear to improve children's EFs. The best evidence exists for computer-based training, traditional martial arts, and two school curricula. Weaker evidence, though strong enough to pass peer review, exists for aerobics, yoga, mindfulness, and other school curricula. Here I address what can be learned from the research thus far, including that EFs need to be progressively challenged as children improve and that repeated practice is key. Children devote time and effort to activities they love; therefore, EF interventions might use children's motivation to advantage. Focusing narrowly on EFs or aerobic activity alone appears not to be as efficacious in improving EFs as also addressing children's emotional, social, and character development (as do martial arts, yoga, and curricula shown to improve EFs). Children with poorer EFs benefit more from training; hence, training might provide them an opportunity to ``catch up'' with their peers and not be left behind. Remaining questions include how long benefits of EF training last and who benefits most from which activities.},

@article{Kraljic2005,
	Abstract = {Evidence has been mixed on whether speakers spontaneously and reliably produce prosodic cues that resolve syntactic ambiguities. And when speakers do produce such cues, it is unclear whether they do so "for" their addressees (the audience design hypothesis) or "for" themselves, as a by-product of planning and articulating utterances. Three experiments addressed these issues. In Experiments 1 and 3, speakers followed pictorial guides to spontaneously instruct addressees to move objects. Critical instructions (e.g., "Put the dog in the basket on the star") were syntactically ambiguous, and the referential situation supported either one or both interpretations. Speakers reliably produced disambiguating cues to syntactic ambiguity whether the situation was ambiguous or not. However, Experiment 2 suggested that most speakers were not yet aware of whether the situation was ambiguous by the time they began to speak, and so adapting to addressees' particular needs may not have been feasible in Experiment 1. Experiment 3 examined individual speakers' awareness of situational ambiguity and the extent to which they signaled structure, with or without addressees present. Speakers tended to produce prosodic cues to syntactic boundaries regardless of their addressees' needs in particular situations. Such cues did prove helpful to addressees, who correctly interpreted speakers' instructions virtually all the time. In fact, even when speakers produced syntactically ambiguous utterances in situations that supported both interpretations, eye-tracking data showed that 40{\%} of the time addressees did not even consider the non-intended objects. We discuss the standards needed for a convincing test of the audience design hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {This longitudinal study investigated the relation between children's early use of symbols and their later understanding of representation and metarepresentation. The performance of 64 children on DeLoache's (1987) scale model task was measured at 30, 36, and 42 months, and their false belief understanding was measured at 42 and 48 months. Language and executive function measures were taken at each time point. Scale model performance was related to concurrent and subsequent false belief understanding, and scale model performance both predicted and was predicted by language across time. Language predicted false belief within and across time, and with increasing age it mediated the relation between success on the scale model task and false belief understanding. Although executive function was related to performance on scale model and theory of mind tasks, it did not mediate the relation between these. This study provides evidence suggesting that symbolic functioning, language, and theory of mind may form part of a single skill set underlying symbolic representation.},

The first study examines 4- and 5-year-olds' ability to answer questions about durations of common phenomena with duration terms. The second study examines 4- to 6-year-olds' comprehension of duration terms with a forced-choice pointing task. Both show that preschoolers' knowledge of such words is incomplete, but that it adheres to the pattern proposed in previous work with toddlers for abstract words. More specifically, children form lexical domains for such words even before they know their individual meanings, thereby allowing the children to often respond appropriately but not usually correctly to questions about abstract dimensions like time.},

	Abstract = {Sharing a public language facilitates particularly efficient forms of joint perception and action by giving interlocutors refined tools for directing attention and aligning conceptual models and action. We hypothesized that interlocutors who flexibly align their linguistic practices and converge on a shared language will improve their cooperative performance on joint tasks. To test this prediction, we employed a novel experimental design, in which pairs of participants cooperated linguistically to solve a perceptual task. We found that dyad members generally showed a high propensity to adapt to each other's linguistic practices. However, although general linguistic alignment did not have a positive effect on performance, the alignment of particular task-relevant vocabularies strongly correlated with collective performance. In other words, the more dyad members selectively aligned linguistic tools fit for the task, the better they performed. Our work thus uncovers the interplay between social dynamics and sensitivity to task affordances in successful cooperation.},

@article{Lovato2010,
	Abstract = {Naps (brief sleeps) are a global and highly prevalent phenomenon, thus warranting consideration for their effects on cognitive functioning. Naps can reduce sleepiness and improve cognitive performance. The benefits of brief (5-15. min) naps are almost immediate after the nap and last a limited period (1-3. h). Longer naps ({\textgreater}30. min) can produce impairment from sleep inertia for a short period after waking but then produce improved cognitive performance for a longer period (up to many hours). Other factors that affect the benefits from the nap are the circadian timing of the nap with early afternoon being the most favourable time. Longer periods of prior wakefulness favour longer naps over brief naps. Those who regularly nap seem to show greater benefits than those who rarely nap. These conclusions, however, need to be accepted cautiously until more comprehensive research programmes are conducted in which all these parameters are varied. Research is also needed to test the benefits of brief naps taken more naturalistically at the time when sleepiness becomes intrusive. The significant benefits of a brief nap, containing virtually no slow wave EEG activity, are not predicted by the present theory of homeostatic sleep drive (Process S). A new biological process (Process O) suggests that sleep onset followed by only 7-10. min of sleep can result in a substantial increase of alertness because it allows the rapid dissipation of inhibition in the 'wake-active' cells associated with the 'sleep-switch' mechanism rather than the dissipation of Process S. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Miscommunication, in turn, is considered a product of noise and random error. I argue that communication proceeds in a relatively egocentric manner, with addressees routinely interpreting what speakers say from their own perspective, and speakers disambiguating their utterances with little consideration to the mental states of their addressees. Speakers also tend to overestimate how effective they are, believing that their message is understood more often than it really is.

High-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) offer a unique perspective on this debate, as they acquire substantial vocabularies despite impoverished social-pragmatic skills. We tested children and adolescents with ASD in a paradigm examining mutual exclusivity for words and facts. Words were interpreted contrastively more often than facts. Word performance was associated with vocabulary size; fact performance was associated with social-communication skills. Thus mutual exclusivity does not appear to be driven by pragmatics, suggesting that it is either a lexical constraint or a reflection of domain-general learning processes. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor  {\&}  Francis. We consider several key aspects of prediction in language comprehension: its computational nature, the representational level(s) at which we predict, whether we use higher-level representations to predictively pre-activate lower level representations, and whether we ``commit'' in any way to our predictions, beyond pre-activation. We argue that the bulk of behavioural and neural evidence suggests that we predict probabilistically and at multiple levels and grains of representation. We also argue that we can, in principle, use higher-level inferences to predictively pre-activate information at multiple lower representational levels. We suggest that the degree and level of predictive pre-activation might be a function of its expected utility, which, in turn, may depend on comprehenders' goals and their estimates of the relative reliability of their prior knowledge and the bottom-up input. Finally, we argue that all these properties of language understanding can be naturally explained and productively explored within a multi-representational hierarchical actively generative architecture whose goal is to infer the message intended by the producer, and in which predictions play a crucial role in explaining the bottom-up input.},

	Abstract = {This research examined the relation between individual differences in inhibitory control (IC; a central compo- nent of executive functioning) and theory-of-mind (ToM) performance in preschool-age children. Across two sessions, 3- and 4-year-old children ( N ? 107) were given multitask batteries measuring IC and ToM. Inhibi- tory control was strongly related to ToM, r ? .66, p ? .001. This relation remained significant controlling for age, gender, verbal ability, motor sequencing, family size, and performance on pretend-action and mental state control tasks. Inhibitory tasks requiring a novel response in the face of a conflicting prepotent response (Con- flict scale) and those requiring the delay of a prepotent response (Delay scale) were significantly related to ToM. The Conflict scale, however, significantly predicted ToM performance over and above the Delay scale and control measures, whereas the Delay scale was not significant in a corresponding analysis. These findings sug- gest that IC may be a crucial enabling factor for ToM development, possibly affecting both the emergence and expression of mental state knowledge. The implications of the findings for a variety of executive accounts of ToM are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Visual illusions and other perceptual phenomena can be used as tools to uncover the otherwise hidden constructive processes that give rise to perception. Although many perceptual processes are assumed to be universal, variable susceptibility to certain illusions and perceptual effects across populations suggests a role for factors that vary culturally. One striking phenomenon is seen with two-tone images---photos reduced to two tones: black and white. Deficient recognition is observed in young children under conditions that trigger automatic recognition in adults. Here we show a similar lack of cue-triggered perceptual reorganization in the Pirah{\~{a}}, a hunter-gatherer tribe with limited exposure to modern visual media, suggesting such recognition is experience- and culture-specific.},

	Abstract = {What motivates a fluent bilingual speaker to switch languages within a single utterance? We propose a novel discourse-functionalmotivation: less predictable, high information-contentmean- ings are encoded in one language, and more predictable, lower information-content meanings are encoded in another language. Switches to a speaker's less frequently used, and hencemore salient, language offer a distinct encoding that highlights information-rich material that comprehenders should attend to especially carefully. Using a corpus of natural Czech-English bilingual discourse, we test this hypothesis against an extensive set of control factors from sociolinguistic, psycholin- guistic, and discourse-functional lines of research using mixed-effects logistic regression, in the first such quantitativemultifactorial investigation of code-switching in discourse.We find, using a Shannon guessing game to quantify predictability of meanings in conversation, that words with difficult-to-guess meanings are indeed more likely to be code-switch sites, and that this is in fact one of the most highly explanatory factors in predicting the occurrence of code-switching in our data. We argue that choice of language thus serves as a formal marker of information content in discourse, along with familiar means such as prosody and syntax.We further argue for the utility of rigorous, multifactorial approaches to sociolinguistic speaker-choice phenomena in natural conversation.},

In five experiments, four online and one in-person, we attempted to reproduce this result. Aggregating across our studies, we replicated the original finding of sensitivity to the sampling process, but with a smaller effect size than the original.

By most theories, idiosyncratic aspects of speech (voice details, ambient noise, etc.) are considered noise and are filtered in perception. However, episodic theories suggest that perceptual details are stored in memory and are integral to later perception. In this research the author tested an episodic model (MINERVA 2; D. L. Hintzman, 1986) against speech production data from a word-shadowing task. The model predicted the shadowing-response-time patterns, and it correctly predicted a tendency for shadowers to spontaneously imitate the acoustic patterns of words and nonwords. It also correctly predicted imitation strength as a function of "abstract" stimulus properties, such as word frequency. Taken together, the data and theory suggest that detailed episodes constitute the basic substrate of the mental lexicon.},

We focus on four categories of intervention that have been well studied. We find that material rewards and increased efficacy, interventions focused on altering the costs and benefits of giving, have at best mixed success. Social Interventions based on observability and descriptive norms, conversely, are consistently highly effective. We then demonstrate how a theoretical framework based on reciprocity and reputation concerns explains why Social Interventions are typically more effective than Cost-Benefit Interventions, and suggests ways to make Cost-Benefit Interventions more effective. We conclude by discussing other less-studied types of intervention, and promising directions for future research.},

	Abstract = {To test young children's false belief theory of mind in a morally relevant context, two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, children (N= 162) at 3.5, 5.5, and 7.5. years of age were administered three tasks: prototypic moral transgression task, false belief theory of mind task (ToM), and an " accidental transgressor" task, which measured a morally-relevant false belief theory of mind (MoToM). Children who did not pass false belief ToM were more likely to attribute negative intentions to an accidental transgressor than children who passed false belief ToM, and to use moral reasons when blaming the accidental transgressor. In Experiment 2, children (N= 46) who did not pass false belief ToM viewed it as more acceptable to punish the accidental transgressor than did participants who passed false belief ToM. Findings are discussed in light of research on the emergence of moral judgment and theory of mind. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In the Rhythm-based Prosodic Bootstrapping Hypothesis, it is proposed that infants' early sensitivity to the rhythmic properties of a language will enable them to adopt a metrical speech segmentation strategy appropriate for their language. Review of the literature shows that while infants are capable of discriminating languages from diff erent rhythm classes, this does not neces- sarily lead them to adopt metrical segmentation strategies appropriate to each and every particular class. It is argued that the rhythm of a language may be salient for infants in all languages, but how this sensitivity is linked to other aspects of language acquisition needs to be re-considered.},

This study assessed the effectiveness of a parenting program designed to encourage verbal engagement between caregivers and infants in Wolof-speaking villages in rural Senegal. Caregivers (n = 443) and their 4-to 31-month-old children were observed at baseline in 2013 and 1 year later at follow-up. Results showed that caregivers in program villages nearly doubled the amount of child-directed speech during a play session compared to baseline, whereas caregivers in matched comparison villages showed no change. After 1 year, children in program villages produced more utterances, and showed greater improvement in vocabulary and other language outcomes compared to children in comparison vil-lages.},

Claims of innateness typically rest on the idea that the input is not rich enough for general learning strategies to yield the required representations. The present work demonstrates that the semantics associated with argument structure generalizations can indeed be learned, given the nature of the input and an understanding of general categorization strategies. Examination of an extensive corpus study of children's and mothers' speech shows that tokens of one particular verb are found to account for the lion's share of instances of each argument frame considered. Experimental results are reported that demonstrate that high token frequency of a single prototypical exemplar facilitates the learning of constructional meaning.},

We propose that children might address this problem by 'sampling' hypotheses from a probability distribution. We discuss empirical results demonstrating signatures of sampling, which offer an explanation for the variability of children's responses. The sampling hypothesis provides an algorithmic account of how children might address computationally intractable problems and suggests a way to make sense of their 'noisy' behavior.},

	Abstract = {Words refer to objects in the world, but this correspondence is not one-to-one: Each word has a range of referents that share features on some dimensions but differ on others. This property of language is called underspecification. Parts of the lexicon have characteristic patterns of underspecification; for example, artifact nouns tend to specify shape, but not color, whereas substance nouns specify material but not shape. These regularities in the lexicon enable learners to generalize new words appropriately. How does the lexicon come to have these helpful regularities? We test the hypothesis that systematic backgrounding of some dimensions during learning and use causes language to gradually change, over repeated episodes of transmission, to produce a lexicon with strong patterns of underspecification across these less salient dimensions. This offers a cultural evolutionary mechanism linking individual word learning and generalization to the origin of regularities in the lexicon that help learners generalize words appropriately.},

@article{Kidd2013,
	Abstract = {Children are notoriously bad at delaying gratification to achieve later, greater rewards (e.g., Piaget, 1970)-and some are worse at waiting than others. Individual differences in the ability-to-wait have been attributed to self-control, in part because of evidence that long-delayers are more successful in later life (e.g., Shoda, Mischel, {\&} Peake, 1990). Here we provide evidence that, in addition to self-control, children's wait-times are modulated by an implicit, rational decision-making process that considers environmental reliability. We tested children (M= 4;6, N= 28) using a classic paradigm-the marshmallow task (Mischel, 1974)-in an environment demonstrated to be either unreliable or reliable. Children in the reliable condition waited significantly longer than those in the unreliable condition (p{\textless} 0.0005), suggesting that children's wait-times reflected reasoned beliefs about whether waiting would ultimately pay off. Thus, wait-times on sustained delay-of-gratification tasks (e.g., the marshmallow task) may not only reflect differences in self-control abilities, but also beliefs about the stability of the world. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

I thought the passages about a) children's variable strategies at any one stage in development, and b) their abstract framework knowledge, with poor detail knowledge represented an interesting echo of our discussion of scientific effort at the computational level, and the underspecification at the level of algorithms and representations (in contrast to the other two levels).

I liked this article in that it seemed to make real effort to consider a broader range of phenomena as part of ``cognitive development.'' I'm still sort of confused, however, and would like to discuss more, what developmentalists mean when they use the term ``cognitive.'' It seems no one would feel comfortable defining it in the negative with relation to ``affect,'' yet that nonetheless seems implicit in most accounts we read. In philosophy, ``cognitive'' refers to any representation that is truth-apt. That doesn't jibe, I don't think, with psychologists' working definition, but I'm curious what the authors we've been reading would propose as a definition instead.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The aim of this paper is to investigate alignment in L1--L2 dialogue. More specifically, I examine to what extent alignment in L1--L2 is different from alignment in L1--L1 dialogue. I investigate different variables that may affect linguistic alignment in the course of L1--L2 dialogue. As more variables, such as differences in language proficiency of interlocutors, affect the linguistic alignment in L1--L2 dialogue, it appears that linguistic alignment in L1--L2 dialogue is different from linguistic alignment in L1--L1 dialogue both quantitatively and quantitatively. I also discuss the mechanisms that permit lexical alignment during dialogue. This study interprets the alignment process in terms of the activation threshold hypothesis (Paradis 1993) and a link is made between the activation threshold hypothesis and Pickering and Garrods' (2013) account that language production and language comprehension are interwoven. Based on Swiss multilingualism, language selection is proposed as the macro-linguistic alignment process.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Recent research indicates that toddlers can monitor others' conversations, raising the possibility that they can acquire vocabulary in this way. Three studies examined 2-year-olds' ( N ? 88) ability to learn novel words when overhearing these words used by others. Children aged 2,6 were equally good at learning novel words--- both object labels and action verbs---when they were overhearers as when they were directly addressed. For younger 2-year-olds (2,1), this was true for object labels, but the results were less clear for verbs. The findings demonstrate that 2-year-olds can acquire novel words from overheard speech, and highlight the active role played by toddlers in vocabulary acquisition.},

	Abstract = {The meaning of language is represented in regions of the cerebral cortex collectively known as the `semantic system'. However, little of the semantic system has been mapped comprehensively, and the semantic selectivity of most regions is unknown. Here we systematically map semantic selectivity across the cortex using voxel-wise modelling of functional MRI (fMRI) data collected while subjects listened to hours of narrative stories. We show that the semantic system is organized into intricate patterns that seem to be consistent across individuals. We then use a novel generative model to create a detailed semantic atlas. Our results suggest that most areas within the semantic system represent information about specific semantic domains, or groups of related concepts, and our atlas shows which domains are represented in each area. This study demonstrates that data-driven methods---commonplace in studies of human neuroanatomy and functional connectivity---provide a powerful and efficient means for mapping functional representations in the brain.},

	Abstract = {This study tests the firm distinction children are said to make between living and nonliving kinds. Three, 4-, and 5-year-old children and adults reasoned about whether items that varied on 3 dimensions (alive, face, behavior) had a range of properties (biological, psychological, perceptual, artifact, novel, proper names). Findings demonstrate that by 4 years of age, children make clear distinctions between prototypical living and nonliving kinds regardless of the property under consideration. Even 3-year-olds distinguish prototypical living and nonliving kinds when asked about biological properties. When reasoning about nonbiological properties for the full range of items, however, even 5-year-olds and adults occasionally rely on facial features. Thus, the living/nonliving distinction may have more narrow consequences than previously acknowledged.},

@article{Baranes2014,
	Abstract = {Devising efficient strategies for exploration in large open-ended spaces is one of the most difficult computational problems of intelligent organisms. Because the available rewards are ambiguous or unknown during the exploratory phase, subjects must act in intrinsically motivated fashion. However, a vast majority of behavioral and neural studies to date have focused on decision making in reward-based tasks, and the rules guiding intrinsically motivated exploration remain largely unknown. To examine this question we developed a paradigm for systematically testing the choices of human observers in a free play context. Adult subjects played a series of short computer games of variable difficulty, and freely choose which game they wished to sample without external guidance or physical rewards. Subjects performed the task in three distinct conditions where they sampled from a small or a large choice set (7 vs. 64 possible levels of difficulty), and where they did or did not have the possibility to sample new games at a constant level of difficulty. We show that despite the absence of external constraints, the subjects spontaneously adopted a structured exploration strategy whereby they (1) started with easier games and progressed to more difficult games, (2) sampled the entire choice set including extremely difficult games that could not be learnt, (3) repeated moderately and high difficulty games much more frequently than was predicted by chance, and (4) had higher repetition rates and chose higher speeds if they could generate new sequences at a constant level of difficulty. The results suggest that intrinsically motivated exploration is shaped by several factors including task difficulty, novelty and the size of the choice set, and these come into play to serve two internal goals-maximize the subjects' knowledge of the available tasks (exploring the limits of the task set), and maximize their competence (performance and skills) across the task set.},

	Abstract = {Jacket: Thomas Gilovich investigates the cognitive, social, and motivational processes through which even highly educated people become convinced of the validity of questionable or demonstrably false beliefs about the world, and the unfortunate impact of these beliefs. Illustrating his points with vivid examples and buttressing them with the latest findings of the increasing number of psychologists studying human judgment, he documents the ways in which human reasoning and decision making go awry and identifies the most common trouble spots. Gilovich first discusses the specific biases and stereotypes that help us process the overload of information generated by our rapidly changing world but frequently distort what we would like to think is reality. Among such biases and stereotypes are our tendencies to impute too much order to random phenomena; to "sharpen" the central point of stories while we "level" or omit important qualifications and situational details; and to remember only positive instances while we forget nonconfirming negative ones. He then looks at the way they operate in three specific domains: beliefs about special psychological powers, beliefs about New Age health practices, and beliefs about the effectiveness of various dysfunctional social strategies. He concludes with suggestions for improving cognitive performance. ((c) 1997 APA/PsycINFO, all rights reserved):},

	Abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {\textless} .05), we found that 15 (54{\%}) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {\textless} .0001), 14 (50{\%}) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high- powered design. Seven (25{\%}) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75{\%}) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen's ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({\textless} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57{\%}), and 9 effects (32{\%}) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39{\%}) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied. Keywords},

	Abstract = {This study is a critical review of the role of frequency of occurrence in lexical processing, in the context of a large set of collinear predictors including not only frequencies collected from different sources, but also a wide range of other lexical properties such as length, neighborhood density, measures of valence, arousal, and dominance, semantic diversity, dispersion, age of acquisition, and measures grounded in discrimination learning. We show that age of acquisition ratings and subtitle frequencies constitute (reconstructed) genres that favor frequent use for very different subsets of words. As a consequence of the very different ways in which collinear variables profile as a function of genre, the fit between these variables and measures of lexical processing depends on both genre and task. The methodological implication of these results is that when evaluating effects of lexical predictors on processing, it is advisable to carefully consider what genres were used to obtain these predictors, and to consider the system of predictors and potential conditional independencies using graphical modeling},

Assessments of EF in children have focused almost exclusively on cool EF. In this study, EF was assessed in 3- to 5-year-old children using 2 putative measures of cool EF (Self-Ordered Pointing and Dimensional Change Card Sort) and 2 putative measures of hot EF (Children's Gambling Task and Delay of Gratification). Findings confirmed that performance on both types of task develops during the preschool period. However, the measures of hot and cool EF showed different patterns of relations with each other and with measures of general intellectual function and temperament. These differences provide preliminary evidence that hot and cool EF are indeed distinct, and they encourage further research on the development of hot EF.},

The mixture model decomposes the marginal distribution of durables ownership across all households, into three conditional distributions (one each for lower, middle and upper classes), along with their weights in the population distribution, endogenously determining class membership. This approach provides a potentially deeper understanding of the dynamics of classes, in particular the lower class, than can be obtained using poverty lines or PCA alone. It avoids many well-known problems with expenditure data, ameliorates the impact of changing survey designs, and enables an analysis of the behavior and membership of classes over time. I use the mixture approach to show that the urban lower class in India became smaller but poorer during the 1990s.},

Discrimination of the same acoustic information presented in a nonspeech mode was found to be continuous, that is, determined by acoustic rather than phonetic characteristics of the stimuli.

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Moreover, we investigated whether the positive relationship between SFON and mathematical skills is explained by children's individual differences in spontaneous focusing on a non-numerical aspect. The participants were 139 Finnish-speaking children. The results show that SFON tendency in kindergarten is a significant domain-specific predictor of arithmetical skills, but not reading skills, assessed at the end of Grade 2. In addition, the relationship between SFON and number sequence skills in kindergarten is not explained by children's individual differences in their focusing on a non-numerical aspect that is, spatial locations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {5 experiments investigated children's understanding that expectations based on prior experience may influence a person's interpretation of ambiguous visual information. In Experiment 1, 4- and 5-year-olds were asked to infer a puppet's interpretation of a small, ambiguous portion of a line drawing after the puppet had been led to have an erroneous expectation about the drawing's identity. Children of both ages failed to ascribe to the puppet an interpretation consistent with the puppet's expectation. Instead, children attributed complete knowledge of the drawing to the puppet. In Experiment 2, the task was modified to reduce memory demands, but 4- and 5-year-olds continued to overlook the puppet's prior expectations when asked to infer the puppet's interpretation of an ambiguous scene. 6-year-olds responded correctly. In Experiment 3, 4- and 5-year-olds correctly reported that an observer who saw a restricted view would not know what was in the drawing, but children did not realize that the observer's interpretation might be mistaken. Experiments 4 and 5 explored the possibility that children's errors reflect difficulty inhibiting their own knowledge when responding. The results are taken as evidence that understanding of interpretation begins at approximately age 6 years.},

	Abstract = {Children with low working memory typically make poor educational progress, and it has been speculated that difficulties in meeting the heavy working memory demands of the classroom may be a contributory factor. Intensive working memory training has been shown to boost performance on untrained memory tasks in a variety of populations. This first randomized controlled trial with low working memory children investigated whether the benefits of training extend beyond standard working memory tasks to other more complex activities typical of the classroom in which working memory plays a role, as well as to other cognitive skills and developing academic abilities. Children aged 7-9 years received either adaptive working memory training, non-adaptive working memory training with low memory loads, or no training. Adaptive training was associated with selective improvements in multiple untrained tests of working memory, with no evidence of changes in classroom analogues of activities that tax working memory, or any other cognitive assessments. Gains in verbal working memory were sustained one year after training. Thus the benefits of working memory training delivered in this way may not extend beyond structured working memory tasks.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this brief article is to investigate four-year-olds' interpretation of attributive measure phrases (MPs), such as 3-pound, and the role of cardinality in mediating children's responses. In two experiments, I demonstrate that children at this age are starting to recognize that such MPs refer to a property of an individual, such as weight per unit (rather than the weight of an entire collection). Accordingly, they distinguish between attributive and pseudopartitive MPs. However, when the opportunity presents itself to treat the number word as referring to the cardinality of a set, some children succumb to this pressure, deviating from adult-like responses. I argue that the fundamental aspect of number word meaning that children take the first few years of life to master - that number words denote exact cardinality of a set of discrete objects - is precisely the aspect they must overcome when interpreting these MPs. However, the evidence shows that four-year-olds are well on their way to doing so.},

	Abstract = {Sentence repetition tasks are widely used in the diagnosis and assessment of children with language difficulties. This paper seeks to clarify the nature of sentence repetition tasks and their relationship to other language skills. We present the results from a 2-year longitudinal study of 216 children. Children were assessed on measures of sentence repetition, vocabulary knowledge and grammatical skills three times at approximately yearly intervals starting at age 4. Sentence repetition was not a unique longitudinal predictor of the growth of language skills. A unidimensional language latent factor (defined by sentence repetition, vocabulary knowledge and grammatical skills) provided an excellent fit to the data, and language abilities showed a high degree of longitudinal stability. Sentence repetition is best seen as a reflection of an underlying language ability factor rather than as a measure of a separate construct with a specific role in language processing. Sentence repetition appears to be a valuable tool for language assessment because it draws upon a wide range of language processing skills.},

Teacher's instructional decisions are based on a mix of theories learned in teacher education, trial and error, craft knowledge, and gut instinct. Such knowledge often serves teachers well, but is there anything sturdier to rely on? Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field of researchers from psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, computer science, and anthropology who seek to understand the mind. In this regular "American Educator" column, we consider findings from this field that are strong and clear enough to merit classroom application. This month's issue discusses math anxiety. Math anxiety is not limited to a minority of individuals nor to one country. International comparisons of high school students show that some students in every country are anxious about math. Is is perhaps not surprising that there is an inverse relationship between anxiety and efficacy: countries where students are less proficient in math (as measured by the Program for International Student Assessment) tend to have higher levels of math anxiety. Topics discussed in this month's column include: when and how math anxiety emerges; which students tend to be most susceptible to math anxiety; social influences that may impact math anxiety; and what teachers can do to remediate math anxiety.},

In four experiments we assess the reliability of this measure and its concurrent and predictive validity in samples of 2- to 7-year-old children.

Four-year-olds were shown pictures in which three out of three objects fit a description (e.g., three animals reading), and were asked to evaluate statements that relied on context-independent alternatives (e.g., knowing that all is an alternative to some for the utterance "Some of the animals are reading") or contextual alternatives (e.g., knowing that the set of all three visible animals is an alternative to a set of two for the utterance "Only the cat and the dog are reading"). Children failed to reject the false statements containing context-independent scales even when the word only was used (e.g., only some), but correctly rejected equivalent statements containing contextual alternatives (e.g., only the cat and dog). These results support the hypothesis that children's difficulties with scalar implicature are due to a failure to generate relevant alternatives for specific scales. Consequences for number word learning are also discussed.},

Children were informed of a speaker's positive (Experiment 1) or negative (Experiment 2) desire to receive a specific toy as a gift before hearing a referentially ambiguous statement (``That's my present'') spoken with either a happy or sad voice. After hearing the speaker express a positive desire, children (N = 24) showed an implicit (i.e., eye gaze) and explicit ability to predict reference to the desired object when the speaker sounded happy, but they showed only implicit consideration of the alternate object when the speaker sounded sad. After hearing the speaker express a negative desire, children (N = 24) used only happy prosodic cues to predict the intended referent of the statement. Taken together, the findings indicate that the efficiency with which 5-year-olds integrate desire reasoning with language processing depends on the emotional valence of the speaker's voice but not on the type of desire representations (i.e., positive vs. negative) that children must reason about online.},

For instance, adults and children make inferences about a speaker's social identity, geographic origins, and group membership based on her language and accent. Although infants prefer speakers of familiar languages (Kinzler, Dupoux, {\&} Spelke, 2007), little is known about the developmental origins of humans' sensitivity to language as marker of social identity. We investigated whether 9-month-olds use the language a person speaks as an indicator of that person's likely social relationships. Infants were familiarized with videos of two people who spoke the same or different languages, and then viewed test videos of those two individuals affiliating or disengaging. Results suggest that infants expected two people who spoke the same language to be more likely to affiliate than two people who spoke different languages. Thus, infants view language as a meaningful social marker and use language to make inferences about third-party social relationships.},

Children develop "scientific literacy" as they begin to learn the language of science (e.g., concepts such as "gravity" or "metamorphosis"), the kinds of causal explanations that are used in scientific theories (e.g., the day-night cycle results from the rotation of the earth), and the kinds of procedures that are used to answer scientific questions (e.g., testing hypotheses, controlling variables). A model of how explanatory conversations may impact children's learning is beginning to be formulated.

This illustrates not just a fact about the world but about language: to know who did what to whom, we must correctly identify the mapping between semantic role and syntactic position. These mappings are typically predictable, and previous work demonstrates that young children are sensitive to these patterns and so could use them in acquisition. However, there is only limited and mixed evidence that children do use this information to guide acquisition outside of the laboratory. We find that children understand emotion verbs which follow the canonical CAUSE--VERB--PATIENT pattern ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Mary frightened/delighted John{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) earlier than those which do not ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Mary feared/liked John{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ), despite the latter's higher frequency, suggesting children's generalization of the mapping between causativity and transitivity is broad and active in acquisition. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All Rights Reserved. Human language relies on a finite lexicon to express a potentially infinite set of ideas. A key result of this tension is that words acquire novel senses over time. However, the cognitive p rocesses that underlie the historical emergence of new word senses are poorly understood. Here, we present a computational framework that formalizes competing views of how new senses of a word might emerge by attaching to existing senses of the word. We test the ability of the models to predict the temporal order in which the senses of individual words have emerged, using an historical lexicon of English spanning the past millennium. Our findings suggest that word senses emerge in predictable ways, following an historical path that reflects cognitive efficiency, predominantly through a process of nearest-neighbor chaining. Our work contributes a formal account of the generative processes that underlie lexical evolution.},

	Abstract = {A well-known effect in speech production is that more pre-dictable words tend to be phonetically reduced. Recent work has suggested that predictability effects result from hardwired properties of the language production system, rather than ac-tive modulation by the talker to accommodate the listener. However, these studies investigated only minor manipulations of listener characteristics. Here, we examine predictability ef-fects with two very different listener populations: adults and preverbal infants. Using mixed effects regressions on spon-taneous speech corpora, we compare the effect of word fre-quency, probability in context, and previous mention on word duration in adult-directed and infant-directed speech. We find that the effects of preceding context and word frequency differ according to listener. Contrary to previous work, these results suggest that talkers do modulate the phonetic effects of pre-dictability based on listener characteristics. To our knowledge, this study is also the first published analysis of predictability effects in infant-directed speech.},

We develop a probabilistic model that learns to understand utterances that describe spatial configurations of objects in a tabletop scene by seeking the meaning that best explains the sentence chosen. The inference problem is simplified by assuming that sentences express symbolic representations of (latent) semantic relations between referents and landmarks in space, and that given these symbolic represen- tations, utterances and physical locations are conditionally inde- pendent. As such, the inference problem factors into a symbol- grounding component (linking propositions to physical locations) and a symbol-translation component (linking propositions to parse trees). We evaluate the model by eliciting production and comprehension data from human English speakers and find that our system recovers the referent of spatial utterances at a level of proficiency approaching human performance.},

	Abstract = {This is an expanded version of a paper given at a conference held in Cape Town, South Africa from December 11--13, 2008 entitled ``The Native Speaker and the Mother Tongue.'' In keeping with the conference's themes of exploring and interrogating the notions of ``mother tongue'' and ``native speaker,'' I consider constructions of languages emergent from the school system in Banaras, a city of approximately 2,000,000 in northern India. I do so, in part, because they offer the opportunity to critique sociolinguistic work on northern India for the different ways scholars have used the notion of ``mother tongue'' to ignore the institutional milieu -- schooling -- through which they emerge in everyday life. It is true that ``mother tongue'' is an incredibly salient notion in northern India, and that what language variety can be said to constitute the ``mother tongue'' exhibits great variety in a single locale. But the rich body of scholarly research on language difference in India has largely ignored ethnographic approaches such as the one I offer wherein schools emerge as a key site for people to imagine the significance of language in social life. In order to indicate what an ethnographic approach to the intersection of language difference and school difference might illuminate, I reflect on audio-taped conversations in Banaras, Uttar Pradesh between people from various class and school backgrounds and myself to show that one language variety, Hindi, emerges as the only ``mother tongue'' authorized for school use. More importantly, I show that such ideological work underpins a specific kind of narrative about what it means to be able to succeed in school but remain faithful to one's ``mother tongue.'' In doing so, I hope to contribute to one of the conference's goals: demonstrating the sociopolitical underpinnings of the notion of ``mother tongue.''},

Children could classify some dialects by locality by age 6-7 years and showed adult-like patterns by age 8 years. Children showed adult-like status ratings for some dialects by age 4-5 years but were not fully adult-like until age 12 years. Solidarity ratings were more variable and did not exhibit a clear developmental trajectory, although some adult-like patterns were in place by age 6-7 years.

We found that in their initial creation of the language, children analyzed complex events into basic elements and sequenced these elements into hierarchically structured expressions according to principles not observed in gestures accompanying speech in the surrounding language. Successive cohorts of learners extended this procedure, transforming Nicaraguan signing from its early gestural form into a linguistic system. We propose that this early segmentation and recombination reflect mechanisms with which children learn, and thereby perpetuate, language. Thus, children naturally possess learning abilities capable of giving language its fundamental structure.},

@article{Jacobs2012,
	Abstract = {A paradox of vertebrate brain evolution is the unexplained variability in the size of the olfactory bulb (OB), in contrast to other brain regions, which scale predictably with brain size. Such variability appears to be the result of selection for olfactory function, yet there is no obvious concordance that would predict the causal relationship between OB size and behavior. This discordance may derive from assuming the primary function of olfaction is odorant discrimination and acuity. If instead the primary function of olfaction is navigation, i.e., predicting odorant distributions in time and space, variability in absolute OB size could be ascribed and explained by variability in navigational demand. This olfactory spatial hypothesis offers a single functional explanation to account for patterns of olfactory system scaling in vertebrates, the primacy of olfaction in spatial navigation, even in visual specialists, and proposes an evolutionary scenario to account for the convergence in olfactory structure and function across protostomes and deuterostomes. In addition, the unique percepts of olfaction may organize odorant information in a parallel map structure. This could have served as a scaffold for the evolution of the parallel map structure of the mammalian hippocampus, and possibly the arthropod mushroom body, and offers an explanation for similar flexible spatial navigation strategies in arthropods and vertebrates.},

	Abstract = {The language children hear presents them with a multitude of co-occurrences between words and things in the world, and they must repeatedly determine which among these manifold co-occurrences is relevant. Social factors- such as cues regarding the speaker's referential intent-might serve as one guide to whether word-object covariation should be registered. In 2 studies, infants (15-20 months and 18-20 months in Studies 1 and 2, respectively) heard novel labels at a time when they were investigat- ing a single novel object; in one case the label was uttered by a speaker seated within the infant's view and displaying concurrent attention to the novel toy (coupled condition), whereas in the other case the label emanated from a speaker seated out of the infant's view (decoupled condi- tion). In both studies, subsequent comprehension questions indicated that infants of 18-20 months registered a stable link between label and object in the coupled condition, but not in the decoupled condition, despite the fact that covariation between label and object was equivalent in the 2 conditions. Thus, by 18-20 months children are inclined to establish a mapping between word and object only when a speaker displays signs of referring to that object},

	Abstract = {Shared book reading provides a rich source of linguistic stimulation for young children. The authors examined whether variations in knowledge of storybooks (assumed to index factors such as frequency of shared reading) were related to vocabulary scores for 3- to 6-year-olds. In Experiment 1, parents' knowledge of storybooks explained unique variance in children's receptive vocabulary scores after controlling for children's analytic intelligence, parents' exposure to adult reading material, and parents' education. In Experiment 2, children's knowledge of storybooks explained unique variance in their receptive and expressive vocab- ulary scores after controlling for parents' exposure to print and socioeconomic status level. Children's knowledge of storybooks indexed cognitive factors as well as exposure. The findings obtained in the 2 experiments suggest that storybook experiences during the preschool years may be an important influence on the development of children's language skills.},

	Abstract = {No one denies that people adapt what they say and how they interpret what is said to them, depending on their interactive partners. What is controversial is when and how they do so. Several psycholinguistics research programs have found what appear to be failures to adapt to partners in the early moments of processing and have used this evidence to argue for modularity in the language processing architecture, claiming that the system cannot take into account a partner's distinct needs or knowledge early in processing. We review the evidence for both early and delayed partner-specific adaptations, and we identify some challenges and difficulties with interpreting this evidence. We then discuss new analyses from a previously published referential communication experiment (Metzing {\&} Brennan, 2003) demonstrating that partner-specific effects need not occur late in processing. In con- trast to Pickering and Garrod (2004) and Keysar, Barr, and Horton (1998b), we conclude that there is no good evidence that early processing has to be be ``egocentric,'' ``dumb,'' or encapsulated from social knowledge or common ground, but that under some circumstances, such as when one partner has made an attribution about another's knowledge or needs, processing can be nimble enough to adapt quite early to a perspective different from one's own.

@article{Vazire2017,
	Abstract = {When consumers of science (readers and reviewers) lack relevant details about the study design, data, and analyses, they cannot adequately evaluate the strength of a scientific study. Lack of transparency is common in science, and is encouraged by journals that place more emphasis on the aesthetic appeal of a manuscript than the robustness of its scientific claims. In doing this, journals are implicitly encourag- ing authors to do whatever it takes to obtain eye-catching results. To achieve this, researchers can use common research practices that beautify results at the expense of the robustness of those results (e.g., p-hacking). The problem is not engaging in these practices, but failing to disclose them. A car whose carburetor is duct-taped to the rest of the car might work perfectly fine, but the buyer has a right to know about the duct-taping. Without high levels of transparency in scientific publications, consumers of scientific manuscripts are in a similar position as buyers of used cars -- they cannot reliably tell the differ- ence between lemons and high quality findings. This phenomenon -- quality uncertainty -- has been shown to erode trust in economic markets, such as the used car market. The same problem threatens to erode trust in science. The solution is to increase transparency and give consumers of scientific research the information they need to accurately evaluate research. Transparency would also encourage researchers to be more careful in how they conduct their studies and write up their results. To make this happen, we must tie journals' reputations to their practices regarding transparency. Reviewers hold a great deal of power to make this happen, by demanding the transparency needed to rigorously evaluate scientific manuscripts. The public expects transparency from science, and appropriately so -- we should be held to a higher standard than used car salespeople.},

The children were divided into groups with a low and a high level of development, as measured by Raven's Matrices and the Reynell Language Comprehension Scale. Using Wertsch's model [Wertsch J. (1985). Vygotsky and the social formation of the mind. Cambridge: Harvard University Press] as our basis, we analysed the cognitive demands contained in the mothers' speech (abbreviation and referential perspective). The results indicated that mothers of both educational levels adjusted their speech to their children's level of development. However, more educated mothers were more demanding and challenging with both low- and high-skilled children, using more abbreviated directives and a higher level of referential expressions.

Participants learned 2 characters' favorite colors; then, those characters asked participants to select colored shapes, as eye movements were tracked. Results suggest that by preschool, children use voice characteristics predictively to constrain a talker's domain of reference, visually fixating the talker's preferred color shapes. Indicating flexibility, children used talker information when the talker made a request for herself but not when she made a request for the other character.

The analysis is based on a large corpus (from 80 pairs of speakers) of task-oriented dia- logues elicited using Garrod and Anderson's (1987) cooperative maze game procedure. As in previous work with adult conversants, our analysis con- centrates on how the speakers establish local description ``languages'' or schemes to describe their locations on the maze. The results indicate that there is strong pressure for speakers of all ages to co-ordinate on common description schemes. However, more detailed analysis of the dialogues suggests that there are two underlying principles of co-ordination operating. While the youngest conversants (7- to {\&}year-olds) show evidence of super- ficial oosrdination processes - establishing a limited common dialogue lexicon and particular common description scheme - only the older speak- ers show evidence of deep co-ordination processes aimed at directly estab- lishing the mutual intelligibility of the common scheme},

However, evidence demonstrating the link between language learning and language evolution is, at best, indirect, constituting studies of laboratory-based artificial language learning studies or computational simulations of diachronic change. In the current study, a direct link between acquisition and evolution is established, showing that for two hundred fundamental vocabulary items, the age at which words are acquired is a predictor of the rate at which they have changed in studies of language evolution. Early-acquired words are more salient and easier to process than late-acquired words, and these early-acquired words are also more stably represented within the community's language. Analysing the properties of these early-acquired words potentially provides insight into the origins of communication, highlighting features of words that have been ultra-conserved in language.},

in all it is clear that utterances that in some sense follow into the child's already-established focus of attn make the task of learning a new word more manageable for nascent language learners.




must be emphasized that, as children get older, there may be less of an advantage for linguistic models closely tailored to their current attn and interests 




the likely scenario is that children are able to follow adult attn in some limited situations from the beginning of lang dev, it is just that initially they are not very skilled at this when the task is to determine the precise referent that the adult intends when using a novel piece of lang in a directive manner

We propose that young children's plans for drawing and writing are constrained by domain-specific knowledge about words and objects. It follows that they have implicit knowledge of the fact that different notation systems must honor structural differences between the domains being notated.},

	Abstract = {A controversial question is whether language acquisition is the result of domain-general or domain-specific principles. Focusing on word-learning, Markson and Bloom (Nature 385(6619) (1997) 813) recently argued that the ability to learn and retain new words (count nouns) is the result of abilities that are not specific to language. In the current experiment, we replicate their empirical finding, but challenge their domain-general interpretation by highlighting a crucial distinction between the principles involved in learning a count noun, as compared to learning a fact. The current results confirm that learning count nouns and facts involve (at least) two common components: establishing a mapping to a designated individual, and retaining this mapping over time. However, these results go further to document that the processes invoked in the acquisition of words differ from those invoked in the acquisition of facts. Children spontaneously and systematically extended a novel count noun exclusively to other members of the same category, but revealed no such systematicity when extending a fact. This illustrates that there are principles that are invoked in learning a novel count noun that are not invoked in learning a fact. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	Abstract = {This investigation evaluated the relations between visual and verbal working memory; state, trait, and math anxiety; gender; and applied and basic math performance in 100 adults. The design tested predictions regarding which subsystem of working memory is associated with both math anxiety and math performance. The study also tested whether the Processing Efficiency Theory and the Arousal-Performance Function apply to anxiety and performance in the math domain. In addition, gender differences in the relations between math anxiety and math performance were explored. Results indicated that math anxiety was the strongest predictor of both applied and basic math performance. However, this finding was moderated by the gender of the participants. Both visual and verbal working memory were found to be significant factors in accounting for the variance in math performance measured broadly, differing from findings in previous studies. Math anxiety appears to primarily impact visual working memory, contradicting previous findings that anxiety is primarily processed in verbal working memory and supporting the hypothesis that math anxiety does not function similarly to other types of anxiety. In addition, results supported the Processing Efficiency Theory but did not support the Arousal-Performance Function relating math anxiety and math performance. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sentence repetition is gaining increasing attention as a source of information about children's sentence-level abilities in clinical assessment, and as a clinical marker of specific language impairment. However, it is widely debated what the task is testing and therefore how informative it is.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIMS: (1) To evaluate the effects of different types of long-term linguistic knowledge on immediate recall, (2) to assess age sensitivity of repetition tasks designed to evaluate these effects, and (3) to establish if the effects are similar across typologically different languages. The study also considers the implications of the findings for the use of sentence repetition as a research and clinical assessment tool.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS {\&} PROCEDURES: Participants were 50 English-speaking and 50 Czech-speaking typically developing 4-5-year-olds. Children's ability to recall sequences of items was compared in seven linguistic conditions ranging from fully well-formed sentences to sequences of non-words. In each condition, children repeated blocks of successively longer stimuli to establish their span.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOUTCOMES {\&} RESULTS: Results showed significant but differential effects of all linguistic factors in both languages. While syntactic violations and presence of non-words dramatically reduced children's span, semantic implausibility and the removal of sentence prosody played a significant but much smaller role. Familiarity of function words was more important than familiarity of content words. The effects of different linguistic factors on spans were the same for both languages and did not change between 4 and 5 years, although average spans increased over this age range.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS {\&} IMPLICATIONS: Children's ability to repeat sentences is more dependent on their familiarity with morphosyntax and lexical phonology than semantics or prosody, with function words of particular importance. Findings have implications for the use of recall in clinical assessment and as a research tool.},

	Abstract = {We propose the coordination of the subjective and objective dimensions of knowing as the essence of what develops in the attainment of mature epistemological understanding. Initially, the objective dimension dominates, to the exclusion of subjectivity; subsequently, the subjective dimension assumes an ascendant position and the objective is abandoned, and, finally, the two are coordinated. This progression, we further postulate, tends to occur in a systematic order across different judgment domains (personal taste, aesthetic, value, and truth), with the orders the reverse of one another in the two major transitions that constitute this progression. These predictions are supported among a sample of seven groups of children, adolescents, and adults varying in age, education, and life experience. Subjectivity is most readily acknowledged in personal taste and aesthetic judgments and least readily in truth judgments. Once subjectivity is accepted and becomes dominant, objectivity is reintegrated in the reverse order, i.e., most readily with respect to truth judgments. Not predicted, however, was the finding that for a number of individuals, both transitions proved most difficult in the values domain.},

@article{akhtar2007joint,
	Abstract = {Joint attention -- parents' and children's coordinated attention to each other and to a third object or event -- is believed to play a causal and critical role in early word learning. However, joint attention, as conventionally defined and measured, relies only on overt indicators of attention, is studied predominantly in the visual modality, and varies by culture. Moreover, word learning can occur without joint attention in typical development, in autistic development, and in Williams syndrome, and joint attention can occur without commensurate word learning in Down syndrome. Thus, the assumption that joint attention is a necessary and sufficient precursor to vocabulary learning is not universally supported.},
	Annote = {Joint attention refers to moments when a child and adult are focused on the same thing, but for most researchers it also includes the notion that the participants are both aware that the focus of attention is shared (Baldwin 1995); that is, joint attention involves the child and adult coordinating mutual engagement with their mutual focus on a third entity (Tomasello 1995)








many longitudinal studies have found positive
correlations between the amount of joint attention in which parent--child dyads engage and children's subsequent vocabulary development (e.g., Tomasello and Farrar 1986; Smith et al. 1988; Carpenter et al. 1998; Markus et al. 2000; Morales et al. 2000). The magnitude of the relationship appears to decrease (Carpenter et al. 1998) or disappear (Morales et al. 2000) over the second year of life, leading some theorists to suggest that experiencing joint attention is particularly important in the earliest stages of vocabulary development (Tomasello 1999). Indeed,Tomasello (1995) has hypothesized that `to acquire a new word . . . the child must enter into a joint attentional focus with an adult' (p. 117, emphasis ours)








traces back to Bruner (1983: 68), who explicitly linked attention and the development of reference: `The problem of how reference develops can . . . be restated as the problem of how people manage and direct each other's attention by linguistic means.'








Vigil (2002) has found no differences in 18-month vocabulary sizes between her Chinese-immigrant and British samples.},

	Abstract = {Young children learn the meanings of thousands of words by the time they can run down the street. Many efforts to explain this rapid development begin by assuming that the computational-level problem being solved is acquisition. Consequently, work in this line has sought to understand how children infer the meanings of words from cues in the communicative signals of the speakers around them. I will argue, however, that this formulation of the problem is backwards: the computational problem is communication, and language acquisition provides cues about how to communicate successfully. Under this framing, the natural unit of analysis is not the child, but the parent-child dyad. A necessary consequence of this shift is the realization that the statistical structure of the input to the child is itself dependent on the child. This dependency radically simplifies the computational problem of learning and using language.},

Here we provide a practical guide to help researchers navigate the process of preparing and sharing the products of their research.

In Experiments 1a and 1b, 3- to 5-year-old children prompted to explain during a causal learning task were more likely to override a tendency to generalize according to perceptual similarity and instead extend an internal feature to an object that shared a causal property. Experiment 2 replicated this effect of explanation in a case of label extension (i.e., categorization). Experiment 3 demonstrated that explanation improves memory for clusters of causally relevant (non-perceptual) features, but impairs memory for superficial (perceptual) features, providing evidence that effects of explanation are selective in scope and apply to memory as well as inference. In sum, our data support the proposal that engaging in explanation influences children's reasoning by privileging inductively rich, causal properties.},

Using a procedure in which infants controlled access to voices by fixating a visual display, infants listened to recordings of natural female ID and AD speech. In Experiment 1, 1-month-olds heard recordings of maternal ID and AD speech, but these infants showed no preference for maternal ID speech. In Experiment 2, 1-month-olds heard the same ID and AD speech tapes but were not familiar with the speakers. Contrary to Experiment 1, these infants preferred ID speech. In Experiment 3, 4-month-olds heard recordings of maternal ID and AD speech and showed a significant preference for ID speech.

We test this by asking children and adults about fictional characters' beliefs about other characters who exist either within the same world (e.g., Batman and Robin) or in different worlds (e.g., Batman and SpongeBob). Study 1 found that although both adults and young children distinguish between within-world and across-world types of character relationships, the children make an unexpected mistake: they often claim that Batman thinks that Robin is make believe. Study 2 used a less explicit task, exploring intuitions about the actions of characters-whom they could see, touch, and talk to-and found that children show a mature appreciation of the ontology of fictional worlds. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

After accounting for child age, parent education, and child ability as indexed by scores on a rapid automatized naming task and Block Design of the WPPSI-R, shared book reading at home made no contribution to the prediction of the literacy skills of letter name and letter sound knowledge in kindergarten. In contrast, home activities involving letters predicted modest and statistically significant amounts of variance. For the areas of receptive vocabulary and phonological sensitivity, neither shared book reading nor letter activities were predictive. Follow-up to mid-Grade 2 underscored the importance of letter name/sound knowledge and phonological sensitivity in kindergarten in accounting for individual differences in later achievement in reading comprehension, phonological spelling, and conventional spelling.},

Here we ask whether gesture is a global predictor of language learning, or whether particular gestures predict particular language outcomes. We observed 52 children interacting with their caregivers at home, and found that gesture use at 18 months selectively predicted lexical versus syntactic skills at 42 months, even with early child speech controlled. Specifically, number of different meanings conveyed in gesture at 18 months predicted vocabulary at 42 months, but number of gesture+speech combinations did not. In contrast, number of gesture+speech combinations, particularly those conveying sentence-like ideas, produced at 18 months predicted sentence complexity at 42 months, but meanings conveyed in gesture did not. We can thus predict particular milestones in vocabulary and sentence complexity at age by watching how children move their hands two years earlier.},

We then consider how coordination, generally, can be understood as temporarily coupled neuromuscular components that function as a collective unit known as a coordinative structure in the motor control literature.

Children's vocabulary comprehension skills were measured using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test at 2;6 and one year later at 3;6. Results indicate that: (I) child-directed speech with toddlers aged 2;6 predicts child vocabulary skill one year later, controlling for earlier toddler vocabulary skill; (2) child-directed speech relates to socioeconomic status as measured by income and education; and (3) the relation between socioeconomic status and child-directed speech is mediated by parental knowledge of child development.

	Abstract = {Social psychologists have suggested that language-based ideologies related to ?stereotype threat? (i.e. variations in performance-based on ability perceptions of language groups) may affect students' academic achievement regardless of school language support. However, it is unclear whether efforts to support students' first language development, particularly for large populations of students whose primary language is not the dominant language, is sufficient for ?levelling the playing field? in terms of academic achievement. We analysed subsets of data from the 2011 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study and the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment to investigate the by-country effects of officially recognised languages on reading performance. Participants represent countries with only two official languages (e.g. Canada, Israel) and primarily used one of these languages at home. Preliminary findings from hierarchical linear modelling show that the dominant official language predicts reading performance unless the minority language reflects a language internationally valued and revered by local stake holders (e.g. English in the United Arab Emirates). Implications suggest that educational resources and programmes should be sensitive to the historical context of country-specific language ideologies and related stereotypical perceptions that favour the dominant language within the school context.},

	Abstract = {The study examines whether speakers exaggerate prosodic cues to syntactic structure when addressing young children. In four experiments, 72 mothers and 48 non-mothers addressed either real 2-4-year old or imaginary children as well as adult confederates using syntactically ambiguous sentences like Touch the cat with the spoon intending to convey either an instrument (high attachment) or a modifier (low attachment) interpretation. Mothers produced longer segments and pauses in child-directed speech (CDS) compared to adult-directed speech (ADS). However, in CDS, mothers lengthened post-nominal pauses in both the instrument and the modifier sentences to a similar extent thereby failing to disambiguate between the two interpretations. In contrast, non-mothers provided reliable prosodic disambiguation cues in CDS by producing post-nominal pauses that were longer in instrument than modifier sentences. Experiment 5, using ratings from 50 participants, determined that expressed positive affect was higher in the CDS of mothers than of non-mothers. Negative correlations between vocal affect and degree of prosodic disambiguation in CDS compared to ADS suggest that there may be a trade-off between affective and linguistic prosody such that greater dominance of affective prosody may limit the informativeness of prosodic cues as markers of syntactic structure. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Main2000,
	Abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, a central mechanism promoting infant survival is the maintenance of proximity to attachment figures. Consequently attachment figure(s) represent the infant's primary solution to experiences of fear. Aspects of the development of the field of attachment are outlined within this context, beginning with Bowlby's ethological/evolutionary theory, and proceeding to Ainsworth's early descriptions of infant-mother interaction in Uganda and Baltimore. Using a laboratory procedure called the strange situation, Ainsworth identified three organized patterns of infant response to separation from and reunion with the parent. Narratives derived from videotaped strange situation behavior of infants in each category (secure, avoidant, and resistant/ambivalent) are provided, together with a discussion of the prototypical sequelae of each category (e.g., school behavior, and separation-related narratives and drawings at age six). The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and the move to the level of representation are also described. AAI transcripts are presently analyzed according to the speaker's capacity to adhere to Grice's maxims of rational cooperative discourse, and three organized AAI categories, or states of mind with respect to attachment, have been identified (secure-autonomous, dismissing, and preoccupied). When the interview is administered to parents who have been seen with their infants in the strange situation, each AAI category has repeatedly been found to predict that infant's strange situation response to that parent. Illustrations of the discourse characteristic of each category are provided, and it is noted that individuals with apparently unfavorable life histories are found to have secure offspring, providing that their history is recounted coherently. Like infant strange situation behavior, differences in adult security as identified through discourse patterning are interpreted in terms of attentional flexibility or inflexibility under attachment-related stress.},

In Study 2 the procedure was identical except that children did not repeat the experimenter's sentence. Priming effects were comparable to those in Study 1. In Study 3, after hearing the experimenter's sentences, children were presented with a block of pictures to describe. Across the entire block, children were more likely to use a particular form if it had been used by the experimenter.

	Abstract = {Understanding the features of and mechanisms behind language learning can provide insights into the general process of knowledge acquisition. Recent methods from network science applied to language learning have advanced the field, particularly by noting associations between densely connected words and acquisition. However, the importance of sparse areas of the network, or knowledge gaps, remains unexplored. Here we create a semantic feature network in which words correspond to nodes and in which connections correspond to semantic similarity. We develop a new analytical approach built on principles of applied topology to query the prevalence of knowledge gaps, which we propose manifest as cavities within the network. We detect topological cavities of multiple dimensions in the growing semantic feature network of children ages 16 to 30 months. The pattern of cavity appearance matches that of a constrained null model, created by predefining the affinity of each node for connections. Furthermore, when word acquisition time is computed from children of mothers with differing levels of education, we find that despite variation at the word level, the global organization as measured by persistent homology remains comparable. We show that topological properties of a node correlate with filling in cavities better than simple lexical properties such as the length and frequency of the corresponding word. Finally, we show that the large-scale architecture of the semantic feature network is topologically accommodating to many node orders. We discuss the importance of topology in language learning, and we speculate that the formation and filling of knowledge gaps may be a robust feature of knowledge acquisition.},

	Abstract = {When we try to identify causal relationships, how strong do we expect that relationship to be? Bayesian models of causal induction rely on assumptions regarding people's a priori beliefs about causal systems, with recent research focusing on people's expectations about the strength of causes. These expectations are expressed in terms of prior probability distributions. While proposals about the form of such prior distributions have been made previously, many different distributions are possible, making it difficult to test such proposals exhaustively. In Experiment 1 we used iterated learning-a method in which participants make inferences about data generated based on their own responses in previous trials-to estimate participants' prior beliefs about the strengths of causes. This method produced estimated prior distributions that were quite different from those previously proposed in the literature. Experiment 2 collected a large set of human judgments on the strength of causal relationships to be used as a benchmark for evaluating different models, using stimuli that cover a wider and more systematic set of contingencies than previous research. Using these judgments, we evaluated the predictions of various Bayesian models. The Bayesian model with priors estimated via iterated learning compared favorably against the others. Experiment 3 estimated participants' prior beliefs concerning different causal systems, revealing key similarities in their expectations across diverse scenarios.},

	Abstract = {This seven-year longitudinal study examined how children's spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON), subitizing based enumeration, and counting skills assessed at five or six years predict their school mathematics achievement at 12 years. The participants were 36 Finnish children without diagnosed neurological disorders. The results, based on partial least squares modeling, demonstrate that SFON and verbal counting skills before school age predict mathematical performance on a standardized test for typical school mathematics in Grade 5. After controlling for nonverbal IQ, only SFON predict school mathematics. Subitizing-based enumeration skills have an indirect effect via number sequence skills and SFON on mathematical performance at 12 years. Early mathematic skills do not predict reading skills at 12 years. Children's early numerical skills, including SFON, before school age are important contributors to substantially later success in school mathematics.},

Here, we expand the literature about this disparity by reporting the relative contributions of the quality of early parent-child communication and the quantity of language input in 60 low-income families. Including both successful and struggling language learners from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, we noted wide variation in the quality of nonverbal and verbal interactions (symbol-infused joint engagement, routines and rituals, fluent and connected communication) at 24 months, which accounted for 27{\%} of the variance in expressive language 1 year later. These indicators of quality were considerably more potent predictors of later language ability than was the quantity of mothers' words during the interaction or sensitive parenting.

	Abstract = {The time it takes to read or produce a word is influenced by the word's age of acquisition (AoA) and its frequency (e.g. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 12 (1973) 85). Lewis (Cognition 71 (1999) B23) suggested that a parsimonious explanation would be that it is the total number of times a word has been encountered that predicts reaction times. Such a cumulative-frequency hypothesis, however, has always been rejected because the statistical effects of AoA and frequency are additive. Here, it is demonstrated mathematically that the cumulative-frequency hypothesis actually predicts such results when applied to curvilinear learning. Further, the data from four influential studies (two of which claim support for independent effects of AoA and frequency) are re-analyzed to reveal that, in fact, they are consistent with a cumulative-frequency hypothesis. The conclusion drawn is that there is no evidence with which to refute the most parsimonious of explanations, i.e. cumulative frequency can account for both frequency and AoA effects.

In Experiment 1, we tested children both with and without differential prior beliefs about balance relationships (Center Theorists, mean: 82. months; Mass Theorists, mean: 89. months; No Theory children, mean: 62. months). Center and Mass Theory children who observed identical evidence explored the block differently depending on their beliefs. When the block was balanced at its geometric center (belief-violating to a Mass Theorist, but belief-consistent to a Center Theorist), Mass Theory children explored the block more, and Center Theory children showed the standard novelty preference; when the block was balanced at the center of mass, the pattern of results reversed. The No Theory children showed a novelty preference regardless of evidence. In Experiments 2 and 3, we follow-up on these findings, showing that both Mass and Center Theorists selectively and differentially appeal to auxiliary variables (e.g., a magnet) to explain evidence only when their beliefs are violated. We also show that children use the data to revise their predictions in the absence of the explanatory auxiliary variable but not in its presence. Taken together, these results suggest that children's learning is at once conservative and flexible; children integrate evidence, prior beliefs, and competing causal hypotheses in their exploration, explanation, and learning. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

	Abstract = {In addition to its communicative functions, language has been argued to have a variety of extracommunicative functions, as assessed by its causal involvement in putatively nonlinguistic tasks. In the present work, I argue that language may be critically involved in the ability of human adults to categorize objects on a specific dimension (e.g., color) while abstracting over other dimensions (e.g., size). This ability is frequently impaired in aphasic patients. The present work demonstrates that normal participants placed under conditions of verbal interference show a pattern of deficits strikingly similar to that of aphasic patients: impaired taxonomic categorization along perceptual dimensions, and preserved thematic categorization. A control experiment using a visuospatial-interference task failed to find this selective pattern of deficits. The present work has implications for understanding the online role of language in normal cognition and supports the claim that language is causally involved in nonverbal cognition.},

T heir interests seem to gradually shift from the study of language processing as an isolated and independent phenomenon towards inclusion of more interactional factors being indispensable components of interpersonal communication and involved in the process of communicative alignment. Alignment is here understood as a complex phenomenon that goes beyond increasing similarity of mental representations and related communicative behaviour. It simultaneously occurs on many levels and in various modalities, including those traditionally excluded from language study. A s a consequence, it implies not only more flexibility in the study of interpersonal communication but it also means a shift in the psycholinguistic methodology and probably also in the widely accepted picture of language and its limits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Sixty infants interacted with their mother at 1 and 3 months of age in a face-to-face context. At 3 months, infants gazed, smiled, and positively vocalized significantly more than at 1 month. These findings point to a transition in infant social behavior at around the second month post birth. In addition, maternal speech to infants increased between these times in both amount and complexity, possibly in response to an increase in infant social behavior. Maternal speech was related to infant positive vocalizing at 3 months, suggesting mothers especially monitored infant vocalizing at 3 months.

	Abstract = {The human potential for language is based in human biology but makes requirements of the social environment to be realized. This paper reports evidence regarding (1) the nature of those environmental requirements, (2) the ways in which the varied social contexts in which children live meet those requirements, and (3) the effects of environmental variability in meeting those requirements on the course of language development. The evidence suggests that all human environments support language acquisition by providing children with opportunities for communicative experience, which motivate the language acquisition process, and a language model, which serves as data for the language acquisition mechanism. Different environments do so to different degrees, thereby producing group and individual differences in the rate and course of language development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Participants were 30 adults who were born deaf and first exposed to a fully perceptible language between the ages of birth and 13 years. Stimuli were grammatical and ungrammatical examples of six ASL syntactic structures: simple, negative, agreement verb, wh-question, relative clause and classifier sentences. As delay in exposure to a first language increased, grammatical judgement accuracy decreased, independent of ASL syntactic structure. The signers were less accurate and responded more slowly to ungrammatical as compared with grammatical stimuli, especially the early and delayed first-language learners in comparison to the native learners. The results held across grammaticised facial expressions, signed markers and verb type. These results, in conjunction with previous findings, indicate that the onset of first language acquisition affects the ultimate outcome of syntactic knowledge for all subsequent language acquisition.},

	Abstract = {Infants must learn about many cognitive domains (e.g., language, music) from auditory statistics, yet capacity limits on their cognitive resources restrict the quantity that they can encode. Previous research has established that infants can attend to only a subset of available acoustic input. Yet few previous studies have directly examined infant auditory attention, and none have directly tested theorized mechanisms of attentional selec- tion based on stimulus complexity. This work utilizes model-based behavioral methods that were recently developed to examine visual attention in infants (e.g., Kidd, Piantadosi, {\&} Aslin, 2012). The present results demonstrate that 7- to 8-month-old infants selectively attend to nonsocial auditory stimuli that are intermedi- ately predictable/complex with respect to their current implicit beliefs and expectations. These findings pro- vide evidence of a broad principle of infant attention across modalities and suggest that sound-to-sound transitional statistics heavily influence the allocation of auditory attention in human infants},
	Annote = {We hypothesized that infants' probability of ter-
minating their attention to sequential auditory sti- muli would be greatest on sounds whose complexity (negative log probability) was either very low or very high, according to an idealized learning model. We found evidence that this was true for the transitional version of the model, but the trend in the nontransitional version was not sig- nificant after controlling for other factors. This may indicate that transitional statistics are more readily tracked by infants in the auditory modality. In gen- eral, our results are further evidence of a principle of infant attention with broad applicability: Infants implicitly seek to maintain intermediate rates of information absorption and avoid wasting cognitive resources on overly simple or overly complex events---in both visual and auditory modalities.

	Abstract = {The goal of the current investigation was to compare two monitoring processes (judgments of learning [JOLs] and confidence judgments [CJs]) and their corresponding control processes (allocation of study time and selection of answers to maximize accuracy, respectively) in 5-, 6-, and 7-year-old children (N=101). Children learned the meanings of Japanese characters and provided JOLs after a study phase and CJs after a memory test. They were given the opportunity to control their learning in self-paced study phases and to control their accuracy by placing correct answers in a treasure chest and placing incorrect answers in a trash can. All three age groups gave significantly higher CJs for correct answers compared with incorrect answers, with no age-related differences in the magnitude of this difference, suggesting robust metacognitive monitoring skills in children as young as 5 years. Furthermore, a link between JOLs and study time was found in 6- and 7-year-olds, such that children spent more time studying items with low JOLs compared with items with high JOLs. In addition, 6- and 7-year-olds, but not 5-year-olds, spent more time studying difficult items compared with easier items. Moreover, age-related improvements were found in children's use of CJs to guide their selection of answers; although children as young as 5 years placed their most confident answers in the treasure chest and placed their least confident answers in the trash can, this pattern was more robust in older children. Overall, results support the view that some metacognitive judgments may be acted on with greater ease than others among young children.},

	Abstract = {It is well established that children with autism often show outstanding visual search skills. To date, however, no study has tested whether these skills, usually assessed on a table-top or computer, translate to more true-to-life settings. One prominent account of autism, Baron-Cohen's "systemizing" theory, gives us good reason to suspect that they should. In this study, we tested whether autistic children's exceptional skills at small-scale search extend to a large-scale environment and, in so doing, tested key claims of the systemizing account. Twenty school-age children with autism and 20 age- and ability-matched typical children took part in a large-scale search task in the "foraging room": a purpose-built laboratory, with numerous possible search locations embedded into the floor. Children were instructed to search an array of 16 (green) locations to find the hidden (red) target as quickly as possible. The distribution of target locations was manipulated so that they appeared on one side of the midline for 80{\%} of trials. Contrary to predictions of the systemizing account, autistic children's search behavior was much less efficient than that of typical children: they showed reduced sensitivity to the statistical properties of the search array, and furthermore, their search patterns were strikingly less optimal and less systematic. The nature of large-scale search behavior in autism cannot therefore be explained by a facility for systemizing. Rather, children with autism showed difficulties exploring and exploiting the large-scale space, which might instead be attributed to constraints (rather than benefits) in their cognitive repertoire.},

While vast changes in the neonatal intensive care unit have occurred over the last 2 decades, little research has addressed the loss of exposure to maternal voice for the preterm infant. To address this gap, we compared studies that directly investigated effects of exposure to maternal voice on preterm infants. Studies reviewed were conducted between 1972 and 2007. All presented recordings of maternal voice at sound levels above current recommendations, and few of the findings reached statistical significance. Some potentially positive developmental effects were indicated. Future study of the effects of exposure to maternal voice on preterm infants using recommended sound levels is needed.},

	Abstract = {When people interpret language, they can reduce the ambiguity of linguistic expressions by using information about perspective: the speaker's, their own, or a shared perspective. In order to investigate the mental processes that underlie such perspective taking, we tracked people's eye movements while they were following instructions to manipulate objects. The eye fixation data in two experiments demonstrate that people do not restrict the search for referents to mutually known objects. Eye movements indicated that addressees considered objects as potential referents even when the speaker could not see those objects, requiring addressees to use mutual knowledge to correct their interpretation. Thus, people occasionally use an egocentric heuristic when they comprehend. We argue that this egocentric heuristic is successful in reducing ambiguity, though it could lead to a systematic error.},

	Abstract = {Purpose: This study presents a meta-analysis of the difference in nonword repetition performance between children with and without specific language impairment (SLI). The authors investigated variability in the effect sizes (i.e., the magnitude of the difference between children with and without SLI) across studies and its relation to several factors: type of nonword repetition task, age of SLI sample, and nonword length. Method: The authors searched computerized databases and reference sections and requested unpublished data to find reports of nonword repetition tasks comparing children with and without SLI. Results: Children with SLI exhibited very large impairments in nonword repetition, performing an average (across 23 studies) of 1.27 standard deviations below children without SLI. A moderator analysis revealed that different versions of the nonword repetition task yielded significantly different effect sizes, indicating that the measures are not interchangeable. The second moderator analysis found no association between effect size and the age of children with SLI. Finally, an exploratory meta-analysis found that children with SLI displayed difficulty repeating even short nonwords, with greater difficulty for long nonwords. Conclusions: These findings have potential to affect how nonword repetition tasks are used and interpreted, and suggest several directions for future research.},

	Abstract = {Children's skill levels in language, mathematics, literacy, self-regulation, and social--emotional adjustment at kindergarten entry are believed to play an important role in determining school success through their long-term association with academic and social skills in primary and secondary education. Hence, children's school readiness is a national priority. To date, there is some evidence that specific individual school readiness skills relate to specific outcomes, but much of that research has not addressed concerns regarding generalization due to the high levels of correlations among the school readiness skills. The interrelationships among school readiness domains and patterns of skill acquisition -- during the first three years of primary education in which basic skills are the focus and in the later years of primary or secondary education when higher-order skills are the focus -- have not been explored adequately. Using the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development dataset (n = 1364), this research conducted growth curve analyses to examine a comprehensive set of readiness indicators in kindergarten and identify which domains were stronger predictors of academic and social trajectories through grade 3 and from grades 3 to 5. Results highlight the importance of examining multiple school readiness domains simultaneously rather than separately, and moving beyond outcomes (skill levels) at a particular grade to consider which kindergarten skills predict gains over time (skill acquisition) both within- and across-domains. Empirical and methodological implications are considered for educational research, policy, and practice.},

However, it is small words like and and or that enable the construction of complex combinatorial language. How do children learn the meaning of these function words? Using transcripts of parent-child interactions, we investigate the cues in child-directed speech that can inform the interpretation and acquisition of the connective or which has a particularly challenging semantics. Study 1 finds that, despite its low overall frequency, children can use or close to parents' rate by age 4, in some speech acts. Study 2 uses annotations of a subset of parent-child interactions to show that disjunctions in child-directed speech are accompanied by reliable cues to the correct interpretation (ex-clusive vs. inclusive). We present a decision-tree model that learns from a handful of annotated examples to correctly predict the interpretation of a disjunction. These studies suggest that conceptual and prosodic cues in child-directed speech can provide information for the acquisition of functional categories like disjunction.},

Six experiments tested the predictions concerning optional word mention of two general approaches to language production. One approach claims that language production processes choose syntactic structures that ease the task of creating sentences, so that words are spoken opportunistically, as they are selected for production. The second approach claims that a syntactic structure is chosen that is easiest to comprehend, so that optional words like that are used to avoid temporarily ambiguous, difficult-to-comprehend sentences. In all experiments, speakers did not consistently include optional words to circumvent a temporary ambiguity, but they did omit optional words (the complementizer that) when subsequent material was either repeated (within a sentence) or prompted with a recall cue. The results suggest that speakers choose syntactic structures to permit early mention of available material and not to circumvent disruptive temporary ambiguities.},

Tool use is proposed as an ideal way to study problem solving in children less than 3 years of age because overt manual action can reveal how the child plans to achieve a goal. Motor errors are as informative as successful actions. Research is reviewed on intentional actions, beginning with block play and progressing to picking up a spoon in different orientations, and finally retrieving objects with rakes and from inside tubes. Behavioral and kinematic measures of motor action are combined to show different facets of skill acquisition and mastery. We need to design environments that encourage and enhance problem solving from a young age. One goal of this review is to excite interest and spur new research on the beginnings of problem solving and its elaboration during development.},

	Abstract = {People can test hypotheses through either selection or reception. In a selection task, the learner actively chooses observations to test his or her beliefs, whereas in reception tasks data are passively encountered. People routinely use both forms of testing in everyday life, but the critical psychological differences between selection and reception learning remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that selection learning improves learning performance by enhancing generic cognitive processes related to motivation, attention, and engagement. Alternatively, we suggest that differences between these 2 learning modes derives from a hypothesis-dependent sampling bias that is introduced when a person collects data to test his or her own individual hypothesis. Drawing on influential models of sequential hypothesis-testing behavior, we show that such a bias (a) can lead to the collection of data that facilitates learning compared with reception learning and (b) can be more effective than observing the selections of another person. We then report a novel experiment based on a popular category learning paradigm that compares reception and selection learning. We additionally compare selection learners to a set of "yoked" participants who viewed the exact same sequence of observations under reception conditions. The results revealed systematic differences in performance that depended on the learner's role in collecting information and the abstract structure of the problem.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

However, high correlations between the amount and the diversity of the input in speech samples makes it difficult to isolate the influence of each. We overcame this problem by controlling the input to a computational model so that amount of exposure to linguistic input (quantity) and the quality of that input (lexical diversity) were independently manipulated. Sublexical, lexical, and multi-word knowledge were charted across development (Study 1), showing that while input quantity may be important early in learning, lexical diversity is ultimately more crucial, a prediction confirmed against children's data (Study 2). The model trained on a lexically diverse input also performed better on nonword repetition and sentence recall tests (Study 3) and was quicker to learn new words over time (Study 4). A language input that is rich in lexical diversity outperforms equivalent richness in quantity for learned sublexical and lexical knowledge, for well-established language tests, and for acquiring words that have never been encountered before.},

	Abstract = {Theories oflanguage acquisition have highlighted the importance ofadult speakers as active participants in children's language learning. However, in many communities children are reported to be directly engaged by their caregivers only rarely (Lieven, 1994). This observation raises the possibility that these children learn language from observing, rather than participating in, communicative exchanges. In this paper, we quantify naturally occurring language input in one community where directed interaction with children has been reported to be rare (Yucatec Mayan). We compare this input to the input heard by children growing up in large families in the United States, and we consider how directed and overheard input relate to Mayan children's later vocabulary. In Study 1, we demonstrate that 1-year-old Mayan children do indeed hear a smaller proportion oftotal input in directed speech than children from the US. In Study 2, we show that for Mayan (but not US) children, there are great increases in the proportion ofdirected input that children receive between 13 and 35 months. In Study 3, we explore the validity ofusing videotaped data in a Mayan village. In Study 4, we demonstrate that word types directed to Mayan children from adults at 24 months (but not word types overheard by children or word types directed from other children) predict later vocabulary. These findings suggest that adult talk directed to children is important for early word learning, even in communities where much of children's early language input comes from overheard speech.},

In the pointing test, children chose the correct referents for words encountered in the coupled condition but not in the decoupled condition. In the looking time test, however, they looked to the targets regardless of condition.

@article{bock1986syntactic,
	Abstract = {Activation processes appear to have an important impact on the mechanisms of language use, including those responsible for syntactic structure in speech. Some implications of this claim for theories of language performance were examined with a syntactic priming procedure. On each priming trial, subjects produced a priming sentence in one of several syntactic forms. They then viewed an unrelated event in a picture and described it in one sentence. The probability of a particular syntactic form being used in the description increased when that form had occurred in the prime, under presentation conditions that minimized subjects' attention to their speech, to the syntactic features of the priming sentences, and to connections between the priming sentences and the subsequent pictures. This syntactic repetition effect suggests that sentence formulation processes are somewhat inertial and subject to such probabilistic factors as the frequency or recency of use of particular structural forms. Two further experiments showed that this effect was not appreciably modified by variations in certain conceptual characteristics of sentences, and all three experiments found evidence that the effects of priming were specific to features of sentence form, independent of sentence content. The empirical isolability of structural features from conceptual characteristics of successive utterances is consistent with the assumption that some syntactic processes are organized into a functionally independent subsystem. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

However, few studies have investigated the underlying cognitive processes. We propose that these experiences have in common a "diversifying" aspect and an active involvement, which together enhance cognitive flexibility (i.e., creative cognitive processing). In the first experiment, participants experienced complex unusual and unexpected events happening in a virtual reality. In the second experiment, participants were confronted with schema-violations. In both experiments, comparisons with various control groups showed that a diversifying experience - defined as the active (but not vicarious) involvement in an unusual event - increased cognitive flexibility more than active (or vicarious) involvement in normal experiences. Our findings bridge several lines of research and shed light on a basic cognitive mechanism responsible for creativity. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

	Abstract = {Although research has shown that statistical information can support children's inferences about specific psychological causes of others' behavior, previous work leaves open the question of how children interpret statistical information in more ambiguous situations. The current studies investigated the effect of specific verbal framing information on children's ability to infer mental states from statistical regularities in behavior. We found that preschool children inferred others' preferences from their statistically non-random choices only when they were provided with verbal information placing the person's behavior in a specifically preference-related context, not when the behavior was presented in a non-mentalistic action context or an intentional choice context. Furthermore, verbal framing information showed some evidence of supporting children's mental state inferences even from more ambiguous statistical data.

@article{Papafragou2008,
	Abstract = {Languages differ in how they encode motion. When describing bounded motion, English speakers typically use verbs that convey information about manner (e.g., slide, skip, walk) rather than path (e.g., approach, ascend), whereas Greek speakers do the opposite. We investigated whether this strong cross-language difference influences how people allocate attention during motion perception. We compared eye movements from Greek and English speakers as they viewed motion events while (a) preparing verbal descriptions or (b) memorizing the events. During the verbal description task, speakers' eyes rapidly focused on the event components typically encoded in their native language, generating significant cross-language differences even during the first second of motion onset. However, when freely inspecting ongoing events, as in the memorization task, people allocated attention similarly regardless of the language they speak. Differences between language groups arose only after the motion stopped, such that participants spontaneously studied those aspects of the scene that their language does not routinely encode in verbs. These findings offer a novel perspective on the relation between language and perceptual/cognitive processes. They indicate that attention allocation during event perception is not affected by the perceiver's native language; effects of language arise only when linguistic forms are recruited to achieve the task, such as when committing facts to memory. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Social class is shaped by an individual's material resources as well as perceptions of rank vis-{\`{a}}-vis others in society, and in this article, we examine how class influences behavior. Diminished resources and lower rank create contexts that constrain social outcomes for lower-class individuals and enhance contextualist tendencies--that is, a focus on external, uncontrollable social forces and other individuals who influence one's life outcomes. In contrast, abundant resources and elevated rank create contexts that enhance the personal freedoms of upper-class individuals and give rise to solipsistic social cognitive tendencies--that is, an individualistic focus on one's own internal states, goals, motivations, and emotions. Guided by this framework, we detail 9 hypotheses and relevant empirical evidence concerning how class-based contextualist and solipsistic tendencies shape the self, perceptions of the social environment, and relationships to other individuals. Novel predictions and implications for research in other socio-political contexts are considered.},

@article{Shneidman2016a,
	Abstract = {In several previous studies, 18-month-old infants who were directly addressed demonstrated more robust imitative behaviors than infants who simply observed another's actions, leading theorists to suggest that child-directed interactions carried unique informational value. However, these data came exclusively from cultural communities where direct teaching is commonplace, raising the possibility that the findings reflect regularities in infants' social experiences rather than responses to innate or a priori learning mechanisms. The current studies consider infants' imitative learning from child-directed teaching and observed interaction in two cultural communities, a Yucatec Mayan village where infants have been described as experiencing relatively limited direct instruction (Study 1) and a US city where infants are regularly directly engaged (Study 2). Eighteen-month-old infants from each community participated in a within-subjects study design where they were directly taught to use novel objects on one day and observed actors using different objects on another day. Mayan infants showed relative increases in imitative behaviors on their second visit to the lab as compared to their first visit, but there was no effect of condition. US infants showed no difference in imitative behavior in the child-directed vs. observed conditions; however, infants who were directly addressed on their first visit showed significantly higher overall imitation rates than infants who observed on their first visit. Together, these findings call into question the idea that child-directed teaching holds automatic or universal informational value.},

Recent advances in neurobiology provide a mechanistic explanation of CPs, with the balance between excitatory and inhibitory processes establishing the onset and molecular brakes establishing the offset of windows of plasticity. In this article, we review the literature on human speech perception development within the context of this CP model, highlighting research that reveals the interplay of maturational and experiential influences at key junctures in development and presenting paradigmatic examples testing CP models in human subjects. We conclude with a discussion of how a mechanistic understanding of CP processes changes the nature of the debate: The question no longer is, "Are there CPs?" but rather what processes open them, keeps them open, closes them, and allows them to be reopened.

	Annote = {Introduction
(a) focusing on unambiguous operational definitions of children's curiosity, (b) proposing some new procedures for measuring a potentially instructable form of early scientific curiosity in children, and (c) presenting some initial data on the development of curiosity in children and the rela- tionship between curiosity and learning behaviors.


Loewenstein's review is organized around four questions: (a) how to define and determine the dimensionality of curiosity? (b) what are the factors that determine the level of curiosity? (c) why do people voluntarily expose themselves to curiosity? and (d) what are the situational determinants of curiosity?


Behaviorist theories:
Focus on attention, rather than drive


Berlyne - empirical studies of curiosity
perceptual: aroused by novelty and reduced by exploration
epistemic: desire for knowledge


specific: desire for specific knowledge or info
diversive: similar to boredome, or stimulation-seeking


state and trait aspects


Berlyne (1954) saw curiosity as having drive-like characteristics but suggested that context can activate cognitive processes that lead to arousal


aroused by environmental conflict or incongruity including, among other things, complexity, novelty, and surprise


Loewenstein, however, suggests that Berlyne's question about whether or not curiosity is a drive is ``probably neither answerable nor particularly important'' (p. 82) beyond the general idea that curiosity is influenced by both internal and external factors.


incongruity theories, suggest three aspects of curiosity


First, curiosity is generated by a desire to make sense of the environment. Second, this desire for sense-making is aroused when one's expectations are violated. Third, there is an inverted U-shaped relation between the degree of the violated expectations and the likelihood that curiosity will be aroused 


Piaget's theory of curiosity exemplifies this: "the subject looks neither at what is too familiar, because he is in a way surfeited with it, nor at what is too new, because this does not correspond to anything in his [schemes]" (*Goldilocks effect*)


Gestalt psychologists suggested that the sole cause of curiosity is the need for sense making, i.e., that organizing knowledge into ``coherent wholes'' is motivating


Other theories view curiosity as an effect of the need for cognition and/or an aversion to ambiguity. However, Loewenstein argues that each of these theories fails to address one or more important factors related to the cause of curiosity, such as the salience of the specific missing information.


The information gap theory suggests that curiosity is a result of feelings of deprivation, which are unpleasant and motivate information- seeking to reduce these feelings


Questionnaire measures of curiosity


Beswick's studies suggest that curious people seek not to avoid conflict, but rather to resolve uncertainty, while continuing to search for new experiences that produce cognitive conflict (Beswick, 1971,in Boyle (1983)). Apart from Beswick, however, most curiosity researchers felt that there might indeed be traits associated with curiosity.


L's criteria for theories of C:
(a) provide a definition of curiosity, (b) address its underlying cause, (c) explain the observed phenomenon of voluntary exposure to curiosity, and (d) discuss situational determinants of curiosity


Additionally, he suggests that the intensity of curiosity is pos- itively related to a person's ability to resolve the uncertainty and close the information gap, and that one is are more curious about things that he or she knows about, because the more one knows about something, the more likely he or she is to focus on what is not known, increasing curiosity in that area


He com- pares curiosity to a type of gamble, where people estimate the likely benefits of satisfaction (the acqui- sition of the missing information), weighted by its probability of occurring---and the costs (the negative feelings associated with missing information) weighted by the duration of those feelings},

@article{Slobin2003,
	Abstract = {The voluminous literature on linguistic relativity has concerned itself primarily with the search for influences of particular languages on nonlinguistic cognition in situations in which language is not being used, overtly or covertly. This represents a long tradition in which anthropologists, psychologists, and linguists have sought to relate grammatical and semantic systems of a language to the worldview or epistemology or culture of the community of speakers of the language. For example, Lucy has proposed a set of requirements for studies of linguistic relativity. He stipulates that such research ``should assess the cognitive performance of individual speakers aside from explicitly verbal contexts and try to establish that any cognitive patterns that are detected also characterize everyday behavior outside of the assessment situation'' (Lucy, 1996, p. 48, emphasis added). In this view, ``cognition'' is seen as a collection of concepts and procedures that come into play regardless of whether an individual is engaged in verbal behavior---speaking, listening, or verbal thinking. Such research is directed towards what Lucy calls ``an independent cognitive interpretation of reality'' (Lucy, 2000, p. xii). A rather different approach to ``cognition'' is provided by investigators who concern themselves with language use and cultural practice. For example, Gumperz and Levinson, introducing Rethinking linguistic relativity (1996, p. 8), underline the importance of ``theories of use in context,'' including formal semantic theories (e.g., Discourse Representation Theory, Situation Semantics) and pragmatic theories (Relevance Theory, Gricean theories), along with research in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. In the present paper, I begin with the fact that human beings spend a large portion of their time in linguistic behavior of one sort or another---that is, we are creatures that are almost constantly involved in preparing, producing, and interpreting verbal messages. Accordingly, research on linguistic relativity is incomplete without attention to the cognitive processes that are brought to bear, online, in the course of using language.},

	Abstract = {The present longitudinal study examines the role of caregiver speech in language development, especially syntactic development, using 47 parent-child pairs of diverse SES background from 14 to 46. months. We assess the diversity (variety) of words and syntactic structures produced by caregivers and children. We use lagged correlations to examine language growth and its relation to caregiver speech. Results show substantial individual differences among children, and indicate that diversity of earlier caregiver speech significantly predicts corresponding diversity in later child speech. For vocabulary, earlier child speech also predicts later caregiver speech, suggesting mutual influence. However, for syntax, earlier child speech does not significantly predict later caregiver speech, suggesting a causal flow from caregiver to child. Finally, demographic factors, notably SES, are related to language growth, and are, at least partially, mediated by differences in caregiver speech, showing the pervasive influence of caregiver speech on language growth. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The settings selected for this observational study included Head Start, primary, and after-school learning environments in a city in the south- east. Specifically, this exploratory study focused on the research question: What are typical daily physical activity and nutrition patterns in community-based early learning settings for young children 4--7 years of age in the United States? Two overarching themes were identified through data analysis: restriction of activity and restriction of physical movement. Results indicated that children in elementary school settings had fewer opportunities for indoor and outdoor physical activity than children in other settings and that children seek to be physically active and will do so when given the opportunity. Increasing time for both structured and unstructured physical activity and play for children ages 4--7 in early learning settings was rec- ommended by the researchers.},

Since accommodation theory's emergence in the early 1970s, it has attracted empirical attention across many disciplines and has been elaborated and expanded many times. (jacket) Here accommodation theory is presented as a basis for sociolinguistic explanation and is the applied perspective that predominates in this edited collection. The book as a whole seeks to demonstrate how the core concepts and relationships involved by accommodation theory are available for addressing altogether pragmatic concerns. Accommodative processes can, for example, facilitate or impede language learners' proficiency in a second language as well as immigrants' acceptance into certain host communities; affect audience ratings and thereby the life of a television program; affect reaction to defendants in court and hence the nature of the judicial outcome; and be an enabling or detrimental force in allowing handicapped people to fulfill their communicative potential.

	Abstract = {This study examined the strategic use of questions to solve problems across early childhood. Participants (N= 54, 4-, 5-, and 6-year-olds) engaged in two tasks: a novel problem-solving question task that required asking questions to an informant to determine which card in an array was located in a box and a cognitive flexibility task that required classifying stimuli by multiple dimensions. The results from the question task indicated that there were age differences in the types of questions asked, with 6-year-olds asking more constraint-seeking questions than 4- and 5-year-olds. The number of constraint-seeking questions asked was the only significant predictor of accuracy. Performance on the cognitive flexibility task correlated with both constraint-seeking strategy use and accuracy in the question task. In sum, our results provide evidence that the capacity to use questions to generate relevant information develops before the capacity to apply this information successfully and consistently to solve complex problems. We propose that the process of using questions as strategic tools is an ideal context for examining how children come to gain active and intentional control over problem solving. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = { The Approximate Number System (ANS) supports basic arithmetic computation in early childhood, but it is unclear whether the ANS also supports the more complex computations introduced later in formal education. `Solving for x' in addend-unknown problems is notoriously difficult for children, who often struggle with these types of problems well into high school. Here we asked whether 4--6-year-old children could solve for an unknown addend using the ANS. We presented problems either symbolically, using Arabic numerals or verbal number words, or non-symbolically, using collections of objects while preventing verbal counting. Across five experiments, children failed to identify the value of the unknown addend when problems were presented symbolically, but succeeded when problems were presented non-symbolically. Our results suggest that, well before formal exposure to unknown-addend problems, children appear to `solve for x' in an intuitive way, using the ANS. },

It revolves around the analysis of the spatial descriptions which emerge during the course of 56 dialogues, elicited in the laboratory using a specially designed computer maze game. Two types of analysis are reported. The first is a semantic analysis of the various types of description, which indicates how pairs of speakers develop different language schemes associated with different mental models of the maze configuration. The second analysis concerns how the communicants co-ordinate in developing their description schemes. The results from this study would suggest that language processing in dialogue may be governed by local principles of interaction which have received little attention in the psychological and linguistic literature to date. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

	Abstract = {Understanding language requires more than the use of fixed conventions and more than decoding combinatorial structure. Instead, comprehenders make exquisitely sensitive inferences about what utterances mean given their knowledge of the speaker, language, and context. Building on developments in game theory and probabilistic modeling, we describe the rational speech act (RSA) framework for pragmatic reasoning. RSA models provide a principled way to formalize inferences about meaning in context; they have been used to make successful quantitative predictions about human behavior in a variety of different tasks and situations, and they explain why complex phenomena, such as hyperbole and vagueness, occur. More generally, they provide a computational framework for integrating linguistic structure, world knowledge, and context in pragmatic language understanding.},

	Abstract = {This paper identifies several serious problems with the widespread use of ANOVAs for the analysis of categorical outcome variables such as forced-choice variables, question-answer accuracy, choice in production (e.g. in syntactic priming research), et cetera. I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow and Clayton [Breslow, N. E. {\&} Clayton, D. G. (1993). Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models. Journal of the American Statistical Society 88(421), 9-25]), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis. Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the different statistical methods. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Fernandes2006,
	Abstract = {An essential part of the human capacity for language is the ability to link conceptual or semantic representations with syntactic representations. On the basis of data from spontaneous production, Tomasello (2000) suggested that young children acquire such links on a verb-by-verb basis, with little in the way of a general understanding of linguistic argument structure. Here, we suggest that a receptive understanding of argument structure-including principles linking syntax and conceptual/semantic structure-appears earlier. In a forced-choice pointing task we have shown that toddlers in the third year of life can map a single scene (involving a novel causative action paired with a novel verb) onto two distinct syntactic frames (transitive and intransitive). This suggests that even before toddlers begin generalizing argument structure in their own speech, they have some representation of conceptual/semantic categories, syntactic categories, and a system that links the two. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Our primary goals in this review are to describe how and why this is so, in order to focus attention on ways to enrich early language experiences across socioeconomic strata. We first review the literature on the relation between socioeconomic status (SES) and language ability across domains in early childhood. We then identify three potential pathways by which SES might influence language development --- child characteristics, parent--child interaction, and availability of learning resources --- recognizing the complicated interaction between the child's own language learning skill and his/her environmental support. Finally, we review interventions that target these three pathways with an eye toward best practice. Future research should focus on the diversity of contexts in which children acquire language and adopt methods of language measurement that are sensitive to cultural variation.},

@article{Haun2006,
	Abstract = {Current approaches to human cognition often take a strong nativist stance based on Western adult performance, backed up where possible by neonate and infant research and almost never by comparative research across the Hominidae. Recent research suggests considerable cross-cultural differences in cognitive strategies, including relational thinking, a domain where infant research is impossible because of lack of cognitive maturation. Here, we apply the same paradigm across children and adults of different cultures and across all nonhuman great ape genera. We find that both child and adult spatial cognition systematically varies with language and culture but that, nevertheless, there is a clear inherited bias for one spatial strategy in the great apes. It is reasonable to conclude, we argue, that language and culture mask the native tendencies in our species. This cladistic approach suggests that the correct perspective on human cognition is neither nativist uniformitarian nor "blank slate" but recognizes the powerful impact that language and culture can have on our shared primate cognitive biases.},

	Abstract = {Researchers, educators, and parents have long believed that children learn cause and effect relationships through exploratory play. However, previous research suggests that children are poor at designing informative experiments; children fail to control relevant variables and tend to alter multiple variables simultaneously. Thus, little is known about how children's spontaneous exploration might support accurate causal inferences. Here the authors suggest that children's exploratory play is affected by the quality of the evidence they observe. Using a novel free-play paradigm, the authors show that preschoolers (mean age: 57 months) distinguish confounded and unconfounded evidence, preferentially explore causally confounded (but not matched unconfounded) toys rather than novel toys, and spontaneously disambiguate confounded variables in the course of free play.},

Accordingly, this study seeks to compare broadcasters' speech rate and the number of pauses in 40 news bulletins from the BBC (United Kingdom), Radio France (France), RAI (Italy), and RNE (Spain). Most authors addressing the medium of radio recommend a speech rate of between 160 and 180 words per minute (wpm). If this rate is considered, only one radio station, BBC, would be within the suitable limits. Instead, higher speeds and fewer pauses have been identified in the RAI and RNE bulletins. The second part of this study attempts to analyze whether perception in the news can be affected by different speech rates. The findings indicate that the extent to which the individuals surveyed experience subjective assessment varies according to the speech rate. {\textcopyright} 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.},

@article{carpenter1998interrelations,
	Abstract = {Typically developing infants show a reliable developmental sequence of emergence of early social- cognitive skills, such as joint attention, communicative gestures, gaze and point following, imi- tation, and referential language. First infants share others' attention, then they follow others' attention and then behavior, and then they direct others' attention and then behavior. The current study used a series of tests from a study of typically developing infants (Carpenter, Nagell, {\&} Tomasello, 1998) to investigate interrelations among these social-cognitive skills in young chil- dren with autism and children with other developmental delays. Tests of object permanence, spa- tial relations, facial and manual imitation, and executive function also were included. We found that for most children with autism, unlike other children, tests involving others' attention were more difficult than tests involving others' behavior. However, within the domains of attention and behavior, the typical pattern of sharing, then following, and then directing was evident. There were several positive intercorrelations among the social-cognitive skills (as there were for typi- cally developing infants), but there also was some evidence of individual differences in patterns. Implications for theories of social-cognitive and language development are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Studies of infant looking times over the past 50 years have provided profound insights about cognitive development, but their dependent measures and analytic techniques are quite limited. In the context of infants' attention to discrete sequential events, we show how a Bayesian data analysis approach can be combined with a rational cognitive model to create a rich data analysis framework for infant looking times. We formalize (i) a statistical learning model, (ii) a parametric linking between the learning model's beliefs and infants' looking behavior, and (iii) a data analysis approach and model that infers parameters of the cognitive model and linking function for groups and individuals. Using this approach, we show that recent findings from Kidd, Piantadosi and Aslin (iv) of a U-shaped relationship between look-away probability and stimulus complexity even holds within infants and is not due to averaging subjects with different types of behavior. Our results indicate that individual infants prefer stimuli of intermediate complexity, reserving attention for events that are moderately predictable given their probabilistic expectations about the world.},

	Abstract = {Two studies track connections from the distal variables of socioeconomic status (SES) and culture to properties of the interactions children experience and to the rate of children's language development. The first study is an investigation of the relations among family SES, properties of maternal child-directed speech, and child vocabulary growth in a sample of 2-year-olds in the United States. The second study is an investigation of the relations among maternal education, maternal "language teaching practices," and child vocabulary and grammatical development in a sample of 2-4-year-olds in China. Together these findings reveal some of the ways in which the social and cultural contexts in which children live affect the course of their language development. Learning outcomes: The reader will become aware of how the social and cultural milieu in which children live shapes their language experiences and consequent language development. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {The acquisition of new skills over a life span is a remarkable human ability. This ability, however, is constrained by age of acquisition (AoA); that is, the age at which learning occurs significantly affects the outcome. This is most clearly reflected in domains such as language, music, and athletics. This article provides a perspective on the neural and computational mechanisms underlying AoA in language acquisition. The authors show how AoA modulates both monolingual lexical processing and bilingual language acquisition. They consider the conditions under which syntactic processing and semantic processing may be differentially sensitive to AoA effects in second-language acquisition. The authors conclude that AoA effects are pervasive and that the neural and computational mechanisms underlying learning and sensorimotor integration provide a general account of these effects.

Under the assumption that communi- cation can usefully be understood as information transmission over a capacity-limited noisy channel, an optimal strategy in language production is to maintain a uniform rate of informa- tion transmission close to the channel capacity. This theory predicts that speakers will make strategic use of the flexibility allowed by their languages. Speakers should plan their utter- ances so that elements with high information are lengthened, and elements with low information are shortened, making the amount of information transmitted per time more uniform (and hence closer to the optimum). In three corpus studies, we show that American English speakers' use of contractions (``you are'' →``you're'') follows the predictions of UID. We then explore further implications of UID for production planning. Key- words: language production; utterance planning; information theory; morphological reduction; contractions Introduction},

	Abstract = {Summary$\backslash$n          There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	Abstract = {Children's aquisition of language and their acquisition of culture are processes that have usually been studied separately. In exploring cross-culturally the connections between the two, this volume provides a new, alternative, integrated approach to the developmental study of language and culture. The volume focuses on the ways in which children are both socialized through language and socialized to use language in culturally specific ways. The contributors examine the verbal interactions of small children with their caregivers and peers in several different societies around the world, showing that these interactions are socially and culturally organized, and that it is by participating in them that children come to understand sociocultural orientations. They emphasize the salient language behaviours of children and others, and show how these are embedded in broader patterns of social behaviour and cultural knowledge. They reveal that various features of discourse - phonological, morpho-syntactic, lexical, pragmatic, and conversational - carry sociocultural information, and that language in use is a major resource for conveying and displaying socio-cultural knowledge. As children acquire language, so they are also acquiring a world view. This innovative approach to the study of language acquisition and socialization will appeal widely to anthropologists, linguists, psychologists, specialists in communication studies, and educationists.},

This study shows, to the contrary, that Zinacantec Mayan infants are socialized as participants in a flux of dyadic and polyadic interactions. I provide two kinds of evidence in favor of the child's emergence as a participant: (1) native evidence based on local theories of socialization, and (2) ethnographic evidence based on a microanalysis of verbal and nonverbal phenomena in different facets of the participation structures in which infants are immersed.},

	Abstract = {Childhood experience with a language seems to help adult learners speak it with a more native-like accent. Can analogous benefits be found beyond phonology? This study focused on adult learners of Spanish who had spoken Spanish as their native language before age 7 and only minimally, if at all, thereafter until they began to re-learn Spanish around age 14 years. They were compared with native speakers, childhood overhearers, and typical late-second-language (L2)-learners of Spanish. Both childhood speakers and overhearers spoke Spanish with a more native-like accent than typical late-L2-learners. On grammar measures, childhood speakers-although far from native-like-reliably outperformed childhood overhearers as well as typical late-L2-learners. These results suggest that while simply overhearing a language during childhood could help adult learners speak it with a more native-like phonology, speaking a language regularly during childhood could help re-learners use it with more native-like grammar as well as phonology. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To do this, we told participants that they were interacting with another person or a computer in a task in which they alternated between selecting pictures that matched their 'partner's' descriptions and naming pictures themselves (though in reality all responses were scripted). In both text- and speech-based dialog, participants tended to repeat their partner's choice of referring expression. However, they showed a stronger tendency to align with 'computer' than with 'human' partners, and with computers that were presented as less capable than with computers that were presented as more capable. The tendency to align therefore appears to be mediated by beliefs, with the relevant beliefs relating to an interlocutor's perceived communicative capacity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Camerer et al. (2018) recently conducted replications of studies from a set of social science papers, and failed to replicate the result on cognitive fatigue from Shah et al. (2012).

We introduce p-curve as a way to answer this question. P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p-values for a set of studies (ps {\textless} .05). Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves -- containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p-values -- only right-skewed p-curves are diagnostic of evidential value. By telling us whether we can rule out selective reporting as the sole explanation for a set of findings, p-curve offers a solution to the age-old inferential problems caused by file-drawers of failed studies and analyses.},

Some explanations for these behaviors focus on personality traits of the poor. Others emphasize environmental factors such as housing or financial access. We instead consider how certain behaviors stem simply from having less. We suggest that scarcity changes how people allocate attention: It leads them to engage more deeply in some problems while neglecting others. Across several experiments, we show that scarcity leads to attentional shifts that can help to explain behaviors such as overborrowing. We discuss how this mechanism might also explain other puzzles of poverty.},

	Abstract = {Previous research shows that the wealthy neglect opportunity costs (Frederick, Novemsky, Wang, Dhar, {\&} Nowlis, 2009). When the not-buying option is framed as ``keeping the money for other purchases'' participants are less willing to purchase, suggesting that they normally fail to consider forgone opportunities. Other research suggests that the poor should be more likely to spontaneously consider opportunity costs (Shah, Shafir, {\&} Mullainathan, 2015; Spiller, 2011). This implies that only the rich should neglect opportunity costs. We tested this hypothesis using Frederick et al.'s (2009) paradigm. Five high-powered experiments (total N = 2325) show that both high- and low-income participants neglect opportunity costs. The experiments used different products (both material and experiential) with both high and low prices ({\$}8.50--{\$}249.99), and different manipulations of opportunity costs consideration. Meta-analyses show a strong effect of condition on choices (demonstrating opportunity cost neglect), and an effect of income on choice (demonstrating sufficient variability in income). However, we do not find the suggested interaction effect of condition and income. In sum, the poor seem to be at least as likely to neglect opportunity costs as the rich. Keywords:},

	Abstract = {Recent research has studied how resource scarcity draws attention and creates cognitive load. As a result, scarcity improves some dimensions of cognitive function, while worsening others. Still, there remains a fundamental question: how does scarcity influence the content of cognition? In this article, we find that poor individuals (i.e., those facing monetary scarcity) see many everyday experiences through a different lens. Specifically, thoughts about cost and money are triggered by mundane circumstances, they are difficult to suppress, they change mental associations, and they interfere with other experiences. We suggest that the poor see an economic dimension to many everyday experiences that to others may not appear economic at all.},

	Abstract = {The poor often behave in less capable ways, which can further perpetuate poverty. We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function and present two studies that test this hypothesis. First, we experimentally induced thoughts about finances and found that this reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in well-off participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks. These data provide a previously unexamined perspective and help explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor. We discuss some implications for poverty policy.},

In one experiment, 9- to 10-year-olds (N = 50), 11- to 12-year-olds (N = 50), and adults (N = 50) made probabilistic inferences. Participants encountered environments favoring either an information-intensive strategy that integrates all available information or an information-frugal strategy that relies only on the most valid pieces of information. Nine- to 10-year-olds but not older children or adults had more difficulties learning to select an information-frugal strategy than an information-intensive strategy. This counterintuitive finding is explained by children's less developed ability to selectively attend to relevant information, an ability that seems to develop during late childhood. The results suggest that whether a strategy can be considered "easy" depends on the development of specific cognitive abilities.},

	Abstract = {Economic models of decision making assume that people have a stable way of thinking about value. In contrast, psychology has shown that people's preferences are often malleable and influenced by normatively irrelevant contextual features. Whereas economics derives its predictions from the assumption that people navigate a world of scarce resources, recent psychological work has shown that people often do not attend to scarcity. In this article, we show that when scarcity does influence cognition, it renders people less susceptible to classic context effects. Under conditions of scarcity, people focus on pressing needs and recognize the trade-offs that must be made against those needs. Those trade-offs frame perception more consistently than irrelevant contextual cues, which exert less influence. The results suggest that scarcity can align certain behaviors more closely with traditional economic predictions.},

Nine- to 10-year-old children in both Illinois and Tennessee evaluated the Northern-accented individuals as sounding "smarter" and "in charge", and the Southern-accented individuals as sounding "nicer." Thus, older children endorse similar stereotypes to those observed in adulthood.

	Abstract = {Research suggests that young children may see a direct and one-way connection between facts about the world and epistemic mental states (e.g., belief). Conventions represent instances of active constructions of the mind that change facts about the world. As such, a mature understanding of convention would seem to present a strong challenge to children's simplified notions of epistemic relations. Three experiments assessed young children's abilities to track behavioral, representational, and truth aspects of conventions. In Experiment 1, 3- and 4-year-old children (N = 30) recognized that conventional stipulations would change people's behaviors. However, participants generally failed to understand how stipulations might affect representations. In Experiment 2, 3-, 5-, and 7-year-old children (N = 53) were asked to reason about the truth values of statements about pretenses and conventions. The two younger groups of children often confused the two types of states, whereas older children consistently judged that conventions, but not pretenses, changed reality. In Experiment 3, the same 3- and 5-year-olds (N = 42) participated in tasks assessing their understanding of representational diversity (e.g., false belief). In general, children's performance on false-belief and "false-convention" tasks did not differ, which suggests that conventions were understood as involving truth claims (as akin to beliefs about physical reality). Children's difficulties with the idea of conventional truth seems consistent with current accounts of developing theories of mind.},

	Abstract = {In previous studies we found that the social interactions infants experience in their everyday lives at 11- and 14-months of age affect language ability at 24 months of age. These studies investigated relationships between the speech style (i.e., parentese speech vs. standard speech) and social context (i.e., one-on-one (1:1) vs. group) of language input in infancy and later speech development (i.e., at 24 months of age), controlling for socioeconomic status (SES). Results showed that the amount of exposure to parentese speech-1:1 in infancy was related to productive vocabulary at 24 months. The general goal of the present study was to investigate changes in (1) the pattern of social interactions between caregivers and their children from infancy to childhood and (2) relationships among speech style, social context, and language learning across time. Our study sample consisted of 30 participants from the previously published infant studies, evaluated at 33 months of age. Social interactions were assessed at home using digital first-person perspective recordings of the auditory environment. We found that caregivers use less parentese speech-1:1, and more standard speech-1:1, as their children get older. Furthermore, we found that the effects of parentese speech-1:1 in infancy on later language development at 24 months persist at 33 months of age. Finally, we found that exposure to standard speech-1:1 in childhood was the only social interaction that related to concurrent word production/use. Mediation analyses showed that standard speech-1:1 in childhood fully mediated the effects of parentese speech-1:1 in infancy on language development in childhood, controlling for SES. This study demonstrates that engaging in one-on-one interactions in infancy and later in life has important implications for language development.},

The overall results have implications for the experimental methods suitable to gauge young children׳s sociolinguistic knowledge and for our understanding of the time course of children׳s development of sociolinguistic competence, particularly their acquisition of the social significance of linguistic variation.},

Finally, in Experiment 3 (N = 48), 6-year-olds used language to infer both where a speaker was born and where they currently live.

	Abstract = {We show that children's syntactic production is immediately affected by individual experiences of structures and verb--structure pairings within a dialogue, but that these effects have different timecourses. In a picture-matching game, three- to four-year-olds were more likely to describe a transitive action using a passive immediately after hearing the experimenter produce a passive than an active (abstract priming), and this tendency was stronger when the verb was repeated (lexical boost). The lexical boost disappeared after two intervening utterances, but the abstract priming effect persisted. This pattern did not differ significantly from control adults. Children also showed a cumulative priming effect. Our results suggest that whereas the same mechanism may underlie children's immediate syntactic priming and long-term syntactic learning, different mechanisms underlie the lexical boost versus long-term learning of verb--structure links. They also suggest broad continuity of syntactic processing in production between this age group and adults.},

For all measures, they found substantial variation across individuals and subgroups. Speech patterns vary with caregiver education, and the differences are maintained over time. While there are distinct levels of complexity for different caregivers, there is a common pattern of increase across age within the range that characterizes each educational group. Thus, caregiver speech exhibits both long-standing patterns of linguistic behavior and adjustment for the interlocutor. This information about the variability of speech by individual caregivers provides a framework for systematic study of the role of input in language acquisition.

@article{Branigan2007,
	Abstract = {We report three experiments that investigated whether the linguistic behavior of participants in a dialogue is affected by their role within that interaction. All experiments were concerned with the way in which speakers choose between syntactic forms with very similar meanings. Theories of dialogue assume that speakers address their contributions directly to their addressees, but also indirectly to side participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, speakers produced picture descriptions that had the same syntactic structure as a previous speaker's descriptions which had been addressed to a third person. This indicated that syntactic alignment is not limited to speaker-addressee dyads. However, the prior participant role of the current speaker affected alignment: prior addressees aligned more than prior side-participants. In contrast, Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that alignment was unaffected by the prior participant role of the current addressee. We interpret these findings in terms of depth of processing during encoding. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
	Annote = {They suggested that these representations are specified as part of the syntactic component, or lemma, of a verb's lexical entry (Levelt, Roelofs, {\&} Meyer, 1999; Pickering {\&} Branigan, 1998). Thus, comprehension of a sentence with a particular structure would activate the syntactic representations associated with that structure, via activation of the rele- vant verb lemma; residual activation of these representations would then facilitate subsequent comprehension or subsequent production of another sentence with the same structure. Alternative explanations of syntactic priming make reference to implicit learning processes, in which comprehension or production of a structure leads to adjustments to the language processing system itself (Bock {\&} Griffin, 2000; Chang, Dell, {\&} Bock, 2006). Published studies show large variation in the magnitude of priming, suggesting that the degree of residual activation (in an activation-based account) or the changes in weights (in an implicit-learning account) that occur following exposure to a structure may vary according to the particular experimental circumstances, task demands, or preferences for alternative structures.

Much research shows partner-specific effects in lexical alignment in both production and comprehension (e.g., Brennan {\&} Clark, 1996; Horton {\&} Gerrig, 2005b; Metzing {\&} Brennan, 2003). Brennan and Clark argued that pairs of interlocutors tacitly set up agreements (or conceptual pacts) to conceptualize entities in the same way as each other, and therefore they lexically align (or in their terms, entrain) with each other to a greater extent than they do with new conversational partners. Horton and Gerrig (2005a, 2005b) argued that interlocutors automatically create an association between a particular expression and a particular partner, so that the presence of that partner cues the re-use of that expression. Metzing and Brennan explained partner-specific eVects in comprehension on the assumption that addressees create associations between lexical representations and tags capturing the partner's identity, or perceptual cues such as the speaker's voice or physical presence. Though these accounts differ in the extent to which partner-specificity is treated as intentional or automatic, they all predict more alignment with addressees than with side-participants. Thus they account well for the existing evidence concerning lexical alignment in comprehension and production, but they cannot explain the pattern of syntactic alignment found in our experiments. They correctly predict that people align more strongly with a previous speaker after being the addressee of the source utterance than after being a side-participant (Experiments 1 and 2). But they also predict that people should align more strongly when recip- rocally addressing a former speaker than when addressing a former side-participant, in contradiction to the results of Experiment 3.

- listeners tend to pay more attention to utterances when they are addressees than when they are not.
- both addresssees and side-participants obey the principle of responsibility in that they pay attention to what is said and update their discourse representations accordingly. But only addressees are required to collaborate actively with the speaker to achieve understanding, and they may attempt to achieve fuller understanding than side-participants
-NOT the case that side-participants just ``switched off'': still comprehended utterances
- differences in attention can influence priming, even when those participants process an utterance to a degree sufficient for comprehension
- more ``active'' mental state encourages processing associated with preparing responses
- depth of processing may depend on communicative context

EXPLAINED VIA NODE ACTIVATION:
Comprehension of an utterance with a particular syntactic structure leads to the activation of the verb's lemma and a combinatorial node associated with that structure. This then increases the tendency to use that syntactic structure again in the next utterance. Because an addressee processes an utterance deeply, the relevant combinatorial node receives considerable activation during comprehension, and therefore there is a considerable tendency to use that structure again. In contrast, a side-participant tends to process an utterance less deeply, hence the relevant combinatorial node receives less activation, and there is a less strong tendency to use the structure again. Thus, stronger alignment effects occurred for former addressees than former side-participants. In contrast, activation is not affected by whether the speaker then addresses the former addressee, the former speaker, or the former side-participant: alignment arises from residual activation that is proportional to the initial activation of a node; hence only participant role at the point where initial activation occurs can be relevant.

EXPLAINED VIA IMPLICIT LEARNING:
Prior exposure to a particular structure changes the weights of connections within the langauge processing architecture. Because addressee processes utterance more deeply than side-participant, exposure would give rise to larger weight changes (and result in stronger tendency to re-use structure) than exposure as a side-participant

- results contrast with the Wndings for lexical and perhaps semantic alignment (e.g., Brennan {\&} Clark, 1996), in which alignment is straightfor- wardly enhanced in reciprocal dyads. It may therefore be that the mechanisms of syntactic alignment differ in some respects at least from the mechanisms of lexical and semantic alignment. This would require some elaboration of the interactive-alignment model (Pickering {\&} Garrod, 2004), which does not distinguish the mechanisms of alignment at diVerent linguistic levels. Perhaps the most obvious possibility is that speakers are more likely to be aware of the lexical and semantic aspects of their con- tribution than its syntactic aspects, perhaps because of self-monitoring (cf. Horton {\&} Keysar, 1996) or because of feedback from their interlocutor (see Brennan {\&} Clark, 1996, p. 1491). They can therefore tell whether the contribution is lexically and semantically felicitous with respect to their interlocutor and produce their utterance accordingly. However, we predict that there will also be more automatic components of semantic and lexical alignment that accord more straightforwardly with the syntactic alignment investigated in our experiments.},

	Abstract = {Scarcity is the condition of having insufficient resources to cope with demands. This condition presents significant challenges to the human cognitive system. For example, having limited financial resources requires the meticulous calculation of expenses with respect to a budget. Likewise, having limited time requires the stringent management of schedules with respect to a deadline. As such, scarcity consumes cognitive resources such as attention, working memory, and executive control and elicits a range of systematic and even counter-productive cognitive and behavioral responses as a result. Specifically, scarcity induces an attentional focus on the problem at hand, which facilitates performance by enhancing cognitive processing of information relevant to the problem, increasing the efficiency of resource use, and stabilizing the perception of value. Such prioritization of the problem at hand may seem advantageous, but it can produce undesirable consequences. For example, scarcity causes myopic and impulsive behavior, prioritizing short-term gains over long-term gains. Ironically, scarcity can also result in a failure to notice beneficial information in the environment that alleviates the condition of scarcity. More detrimentally, scarcity directly impairs cognitive function, which can lead to suboptimal decisions and choices that exacerbate the condition of scarcity. Thus, scarcity means not only a shortage of physical resources (e.g., money or time) but also a deficit of cognitive resources (e.g., attention, executive control). The cognitive deficits under scarcity are particularly problematic because they impair performance and lead to counter-productive behaviors that deepen the cycle of scarcity. In addition, people under financial scarcity suffer from stigmas and stereotypes associated with poverty. These social perceptions of poverty further burden the mind by consuming cognitive resources, weakening performance in the poor. Understanding the cognitive and behavioral responses to scarcity provides new insights into why the poor remain poor, identifying the psychological causes of scarcity, and illuminating potential interventions to stop the cycle of scarcity. These insights have important implications for the design and the implementation of policies and services targeting the populations under scarcity.},

Reg- ularities and differences in the age of acquisition for words across languages yield insights regarding the mechanisms guiding word learning. In a large-scale corpus analysis, we estimate the ages at which 9,200 children learn 300-400 words in seven languages, predicting them on the basis of independently-derived linguistic, environmental, and concep- tual factors. Predictors were surprisingly consistent across lan- guages, but varied across development and as a function of lexical category (e.g., concreteness predicted nouns while lin- guistic structure predicted function words). By leveraging data at a significantly larger scale than previous work, our analyses highlight the power that emerges from unifying previously dis- parate theories, but also reveal the amount of reliable variation that still remains unexplained.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Readers who have seen the Harry Potter movies before reading the novels may ``hear'' actors' voices in their heads when they later read the books. This phenomenon of mentally simulating the voice of speakers depicted in texts has been referred to as auditory perceptual simulation (APS). How much is this mental simulation of voices like listening to actual voices? Two event-related potential (ERP) experiments examined the auditory perceptual simulation of native and non-native English speech while participants silently read English sentences containing subject-verb agreement errors or pronoun-case errors. The aim was to compare readers' ERPs when imagining native and non-native speech to the results of Hanul{\'{i}}kov{\'{a}} van Alphen, van Goch, and Weber (2012), who recorded ERPs while participants listened to native and non-native speech and found that native-speaking listeners ``forgive'' errors (signaled by reduced P600 effects) by non-native speakers. Our participants listened to samples of a native and a non-native English speaker's speech and were then asked to imagine the voice of either one or the other speaker while reading sentences. Results revealed differences in N400 and P600 waveforms when imagining the non-native speaker's voice compared to the native speaker's voice. Importantly, when imagining the non-native speaker committing subject-verb agreement errors, P600 amplitudes were no different from error-free items.},

	Abstract = {This research examines how the salience of scarcity influences choices of individual items from a product class. The authors propose that overall perception of scarcity versus overall perception of abundance increases choice share of the most-preferred item from a product class. They argue that this phenomenon occurs because scarcity induces arousal and the heightened arousal polarizes the evaluations of individual items contained in the choice set. The results from five experiments show that scarcity versus abundance broadens the discrepancy between the liking of the favorite and nonfavorite items and leads to a greater choice share of the favorite item. The findings provide support for the arousal-based explanation, showing that the effect of scarcity salience on choices is mediated by consumers' reported arousal level and moderated by an experimentally induced arousal state.},

	Abstract = {Human infants with little or no crawling experience surprisingly show no wariness of heights, but such wariness becomes exceptionally strong over the life span. Neither depth perception nor falling experiences explain this extraordinary developmental shift; however, something about locomotor experience does. The crucial component of locomotor experience in this emotional change is developments in visual proprioception-the optically based perception of self-movement. Precrawling infants randomly assigned to drive a powered mobility device showed significantly greater visual proprioception, and significantly greater wariness of heights, than did controls. More important, visual proprioception mediated the relation between wariness of heights and locomotor experience. In a separate study, crawling infants' visual proprioception predicted whether they would descend onto the deep side of a visual cliff, a finding that confirms the importance of visual proprioception in the development of wariness of heights.},

Infants with difficult temperaments may be more susceptible to the effects of parenting than infants with less difficult temperaments. Using latent change curve analyses to analyze data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care, the current study found that temperament moderated associations between maternal parenting styles during early childhood and children's first-grade academic competence, social skills, and relationships with teachers and peers. Relations between parenting and first-grade outcomes were stronger for difficult than for less difficult infants. Infants with difficult temperaments had better adjustment than less difficult infants when parenting quality was high and poorer adjustment when parenting quality was lower.},

@article{Zweig2009,
	Abstract = {Bare plurals (dogs) behave in ways that quantified plurals (some dogs) do not. For instance, while the sentence John owns dogs implies that John owns more than one dog, its negation John does not own dogs does not mean "John does not own more than one dog", but rather "John does not own a dog". A second puzzling behavior is known as the dependent plural reading; when in the scope of another plural, the 'more than one' meaning of the plural is not distributed over, but the existential force of the plural is. For example, My friends attend good schools requires that each of my friends attend one good school, not more, while at the same time being inappropriate if all my friends attend the same school. This paper shows that both these phenomena, and others, arise from the same cause. Namely, the plural noun itself does not assert 'more than one', but rather the plural denotes a predicate that is number neutral (unspecified for cardinality). The 'more than one' meaning arises as an scalar implicature, relying on the scalar relationship between the bare plural and its singular alternative, and calculated in a sub-sentential domain; namely, before existential closure of the event variable. Finally, implications of this analysis will be discussed for the analysis of the quantified noun phrases that interact with bare plurals, such as indefinite numeral DPs (three boys), and singular universals (every boy).},
