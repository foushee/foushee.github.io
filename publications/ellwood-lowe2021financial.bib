    abstract = {Parents with fewer educational and economic resources (low socioeconomic-status, SES) tend to speak less to their children, with consequences for children's later life outcomes. Despite this well-established and highly popularized link, less research addresses why the SES ``word gap'' exists. Moreover, while research has assessed individual-level contributors to the word gap---like differences in parenting knowledge---we know little about how structural constraints that vary according to SES might affect caregivers' speech. In two pre-registered studies, we test whether experiencing financial scarcity can suppress caregiversâ€™ speech to their children. Study 1 suggests that higher-SES caregivers who are prompted to reflect on scarcity---particularly those who reflect on financial scarcity---speak less to their 3--year-olds in a subsequent play session, relative to a control group. Study 2 suggests that mid- to higher-SES caregivers engage in fewer back-and-forth exchanges with their children at the end of the month---when they are more likely to be experiencing financial hardship---than the rest of the month. These studies provide preliminary evidence that---above and beyond caregivers' individual characteristics---structural constraints may affect how much parents speak to their children.}
