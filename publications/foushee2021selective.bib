abstract = {Children are thought to learn best from information that is appropriate for them, given their current level of competence.
But what role might learners themselves play in actively selecting and attending to such information? We introduce a novel method to investigate whether children's attention to spoken language is responsive to its complexity or appropriateness. Preschoolers (4--6 years, M=4.6) watched a video where a distracting animation accompanied the illustrations of a storybook. The audio narration for each page of the storybook was looped such that the story progressed faster if the child looked at the distractor for an extended period of time, indicating their loss of attention towards the story. We manipulated the complexity of the narration in two between-subjects conditions: the Simple narration contained largely familiar words, while the Complex narration contained many words typically acquired later. Children's learning was measured via post-tests of their plot comprehension and unfamiliar word knowledge. Children hearing the Complex speech were less likely to listen past the minimum duration of each page, and showed decreased gaze to the story illustrations. Across complexity levels and controlling for age, children's selective attention to the speech was significantly related to their plot knowledge. In the Complex condition --- where children heard the unfamiliar words we tested in the story narration --- children's attention also predicted their word learning accuracy. Our results provide evidence that young children may actively direct their attention toward linguistic input that is most appropriate for their current level of cognitive and linguistic development, which may provide the best learning opportunities.}
